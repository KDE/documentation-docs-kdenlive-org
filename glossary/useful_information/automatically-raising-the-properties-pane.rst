Automatically Raising the Properties Pane
=========================================

Depending on your workflow habits, you can configure **when to raise the properties pane** (in case itâ€™s currently hidden). Please note that this new configuration option will be available only from Kdenlive 16.12.0 on.

To configure when Kdenlive should automatically raise the properties pane, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Kdenlive` then tab :guilabel:`Timeline`.

You should now see a group titled **Raise properties pane when selecting in timeline**, which contains these three check boxes:

* when selecting timeline **clips**,
* when selecting **transitions**,
* when selecting **tracks**.

Simply check the timeline elements for which you want the properties pane to be automatically raised (shown) when you select them in the timeline.

The default (classic) behavior of Kdenlive is to automatically raise the properties pane for all clips, transitions, and tracks.
