.. rubric:: Notes

The objective of a normalization is to raise the audio level to its set maximum while the loudest part of the audio must not be exceeded. Normally, normalization is useful if the audio signal was low already during recording due to wrong or faulty settings in the recording device or too big of a distance between microphone and audio source.
