.. rubric:: Description

This effect/filter turns a certain :abbr:`HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)` range into transparency.

This filter measures color difference between set HSV color in options and ones measured in video stream. Depending on options, output colors can be changed to transparent by adding alpha channel.


.. rubric:: Parameters

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :width: 100%
   :widths: 20 10 70
   :class: table-wrap

   * - Parameter
     - Value
     - Description
   * - Hue
     - Degrees
     - Set the :term:`hue` value which will be used in color difference calculation. Allowed range is from -360.000 to 360.000. Default value is 0.000.
   * - Saturation
     - Float
     - Set the :term:`saturation` value which will be used in color difference calculation. Allowed range is from -1.000 to 1.000. Default value is 0.000.
   * - Value
     - Float
     - Set the value which will be used in color difference calculation. Allowed range is from -1.000 to 1.000. Default value is 0.000.
   * - Similarity
     - Percentage
     - Set similarity percentage with the key color. Allowed range is from 0.000% to 100.000%. Default value is 0.010.  0.001 matches only the exact key color, while 1.000 matches everything.
   * - Blend
     - Percentage
     - Blend percentage. Allowed range is from 0.0% to 100.0%. Default value is 0.0%. 0.0% makes pixels either fully transparent or not transparent at all. Lower values result in more transparency, with a higher transparency the more similar the pixel's color is to the key color.
