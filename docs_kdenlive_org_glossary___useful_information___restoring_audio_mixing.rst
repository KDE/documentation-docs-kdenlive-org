Restoring Audio Mixing
======================

.. versionadded:: 16.08

Nobody’s perfect. So yes, once in a while you may experience unexpected odd audio mixing in Kdenlive projects. While audio from some tracks will mix properly, audio from certain other tracks mutes all remaining tracks. Rejoice! Kdenlive 16.08 now comes to your rescue.

Restoring proper audio mixing is easy:

   1. **Load your project** into Kdenlive 16.08 (or later).
   2. **Add a new track** to your timeline; whether it’s an audio or video track doesn’t matter.
   3. Then you may **delete** this track again, if you don’t plan to use it anyway.
   4. Check playback.
   5. **Save** your project.

No, I’m serious – even if this sounds exactly like clueless support advice. If you now play your project in the timeline, automatic audio mixing across all timeline tracks should work again normally.

.. note::

   This upgrades your Kdenlive projects to the most recent project version. So you won’t be able to edit it again in an older or ancient Kdenlive version.

As a few of my very own projects had issues with audio mixing I could successfully fix them using Kdenlive 16.08. Enjoy!
