   Clip Monitor elements

The Clip Monitor displays the unedited\ [#f1]_ clip that is currently selected in the :doc:`Project Bin </project_and_asset_management/project_bin>`. It has the same functions and options as the :ref:`ui-monitors_project_monitor` except for the |kdenlive-add-clip| icon which adds the clip zone to the Project Bin where it will appear as child clip underneath the clip. See :ref:`ui-monitors_cm_clip_zone` for more details.

   Clip Monitor options

* **Volume** - Set the Clip Monitor playback volume. This does not affect the master volume setting.

* **Go to Marker** - If :term:`markers` are defined for the clip the list of markers is displayed and selecting one positions the :term:`playhead` at the marker's timecode.

* **Force Monitor Size** - You can force the Clip Monitor to display the video at 100% (original size), 50% or adjust it to the Clip Monitor widget's size (Free Resize).

* **Background Color** - Set the background color for the Clip Monitor

* **Extract Zone** - Saves the current :term:`zone` as a :file:`.mlt` file and adds it to the :term:`project bin` if :guilabel:`Add clip to project` is selected. See also *Extract Zone* in the :ref:`ui-monitors_cm_rightclick` section below.

* **Set Current Image as Thumbnail** - Takes the a snapshot of the current frame and uses that as the thumbnail for the clip.

* **Always show audio thumbnails** -

* **Audio Scrubbing** - If enabled plays the audio track while scrubbing through the timeline. You may want to turn this off to improve scrubbing performance or if the noise is distracting.

* **Show Audio Levels** - If enabled shows the frequency curve of the master audio in the Project Monitor.

* **Show Source Timecode** -

Creating Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zones are defined regions of clips that are indicated by a colored section in the clip monitor's timeline - see item 3 above. The beginning of a zone is set by clicking |zone-in| or pressing :kbd:`I`. The end of a zone is set by clicking |zone-out| or pressing :kbd:`O`.

   Clip Monitor right-click menu options

These are the menu items that are available when you right-click in the Clip Monitor. These actions affect the clip that is currently selected in the :doc:`project bin</project_and_asset_management/project_bin>`. Similar menu items are available from a right-click menu in the :ref:`ui-monitors_project_monitor`. However, the project monitor menu items affect the currently selected clip on the :ref:`timeline`.

Seeking
~~~~~~~

.. .. versionadded:: 20.08.0

Inside the clip monitor: hold down :kbd:`Shift` and move the mouse left/right.


.. _ui-monitors_cm_drag_av_into_timeline:

Drag Audio or Video Only to Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. .. versionadded:: 19.04.0

It is possible to drag only the video or audio stream of a clip from the project bin or clip monitor to the timeline

.. figure:: /images/user_interface/kdenlive2304_ui-monitors_cm_av_only.webp
   :width: 250px
   :figwidth: 250px
   :align: left
   :alt: kdenlive2304_ui-monitors_cm_av_only

..

Move with the mouse to the lower left-hand corner of the clip monitor to access the video (1) and audio (2) icons. Left click on the respective icon to drag either the video or audio stream into the timeline.

.. rst-class:: clear-both

This is very useful if you only need one of the streams as it avoids the un-grouping and subsequent deletion of one of the streams of the clip in the timeline.



**Notes**

.. [#f1] "Unedited" means without any cuts. Please note that clips in the Project Bin can have effects and hence people may consider them "edited".
