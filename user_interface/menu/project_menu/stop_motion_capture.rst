Stop Motion Capture
===================

.. contents::

Capture images a frame at a time from a camera plugged into the HDMI port of a Linux-compatible capture card to create stop motion animation. You can also transparently overlay the last captured frame on the monitor to easily see the difference with current live feed.

See `j-b-m's blog <http://kdenlive.org/users/j-b-m/coming-soon-your-desktop>`_ on this feature.
