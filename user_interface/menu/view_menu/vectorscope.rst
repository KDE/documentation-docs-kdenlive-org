Vectorscope Window
==================

.. contents::

This window allows you to monitor the colour properties of your clip in detail.

The Vectorscope shows the hue and saturation distribution in a way we can understand without problems. This is useful for quickly recognizing color casts, but also helps judging the color distribution of a clip and matching it to others. 

:ref:`See Granjow's blog here <vectorscope_working>` and :ref:`here <vectorscope_i-q_lines>` on the Vectorscope.
