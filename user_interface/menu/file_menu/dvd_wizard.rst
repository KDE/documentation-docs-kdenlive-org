DVD Wizard
==========

.. contents::




.. note:: Removed since Version 21.08

  With the move to MLT7 the DVD Wizard was removed as it was unmaintained since long.


This feature allows you to author a DVD with a simple menu. Nothing flashy.


Screen 1 of the DVD Wizard
--------------------------



Select a file here that you have rendered using one of the :ref:`render`.

First click on the **00:00:00** in the center to select a file to play. Then play the file in the preview window and add chapters at the cursor's time point by clicking the :menuselection:`Add Chapter` button.

Screen 3 of the DVD Wizard

The first two buttons on the side allow you to add and delete menu buttons. You define what the button does using the **Target** drop down list.

Screen 4 of the DVD Wizard
--------------------------
  


Click the :menuselection:`Create ISO Image` button on this screen to author your DVD. Click :menuselection:`Finish` only after you have clicked  :menuselection:`Create ISO Image` button. Clicking :menuselection:`Finish` closes the DVD wizard without prompting for you to complete the job.

Resulting iso-file can then be written into writable DVD-disk using programs like K3b. File can also be viewed with most video player applications like Kaffeine, Vlc or Smplayer (Disk menu might have issues to play correctly).
