Download New Wipes
==================

This feature allows you to download and install files that can be used as Wipe files in the :doc:`/compositing/transitions/wipe` transition.  These files are greyscale images in the :file:`.pgm` format. 

If you have your own wipe files that you would like to share with the community you can upload them to the |kde_store| which makes them available for other users of Kdenlive from this *Download New Wipes* function.
