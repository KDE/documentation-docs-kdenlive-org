Undo
----

:menuselection:`Edit --> Undo` is used to reverse the last change you made or operation you performed in Kdenlive.  If you have made multiple changes to your project, **Undo** can be used repeatedly to rollback each of the changes in the reverse order they were performed. **Undo** can also be executed from the icon on the **Extra Toolbar** (:menuselection:`Settings --> Toolbars Shown`) or by using the keyboard shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl + Z`.

To view a navigable list of all the changes which can be undone, see :ref:`Undo_History`.

Redo
----

:menuselection:`Edit --> Redo` reverses the previous :`Undo`_ operation. The default keyboard shortcut is :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + Z`.
