Edit Clip
=========

.. contents::

This option is available from :ref:`clip_menu` for audio and image files. It is greyed out for video clips. It opens the clip in an external editor.

Selecting :menuselection:`Edit Clip` on audio clips causes the audio editing software specified in :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Kdenlive... --> Environment page --> Default Apps tab` to open the audio clip ready for editing. `Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/>`_ is the app that is configured by default to be the audio editing tool for Kdenlive.

Selecting :menuselection:`Edit Clip` on image clips causes the image editing software specified in :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Kdenlive... --> Environment page --> Default Apps tab` to open the image file ready for editing. `Krita <https://krita.org/>`_ is the app that is configured by default to be the audio editing tool for Kdenlive.

The option is not available for video clips because **Kdenlive** is the video editor - only audio and image clips are edited by external software.
