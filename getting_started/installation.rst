Minimum System Requirements
Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------

**Operating system:** 64-bit Windows 7 or newer, Apple macOS 10.15 (Catalina) [1]_ or newer and on M1, 64-bit Linux. Please see the details below.

**CPU:** x86 Intel or AMD; at least one 2 GHz core for SD video, 4 cores for HD video, and 8 cores for 4K video. Please see the details below.
**CPU:** x86 Intel or AMD; at least one 2 GHz core for SD video, 4 cores for HD video, and 8 cores for 4K video. Please see the details below.

**GPU:** OpenGL 2.0 that works correctly and is compatible. On Windows, you can also use a card with good, compatible DirectX 9 or 11 drivers.

**RAM:** At least 4 GB for SD video, 8 GB for HD video, and 16 GB for 4K video.

.. tip:: If your computer is at the lower end of CPU and RAM requirements, you should use the :ref:`Preview Resolution <ui-monitors_preview_resolution>`, :ref:`Proxy<configure_proxy_clips>` and :doc:`/tips_and_tricks/tips_and_tricks/timeline_preview_rendering` features to help reduce preview lag.
   
.. note:: Video editing is in general relying heavily on CPU power. While Kdenlive has render profiles with GPU support, timeline playback uses the CPU. Therefore, the more powerful your CPU the better the playback performance of Kdenlive. More and better GPU support is on the near-term roadmap.
