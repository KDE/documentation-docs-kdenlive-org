  * What is kdenlive good for? (Editing videos â€¦)   * Where is it located? (Semi-Pro?) Alternatives? (Cinelerra, OpenShot, Lightworks, ...)   * What components does kdenlive use? See `this image <http://kdenlive.org/sites/default/files/images/kdenlive-mlt-diagram.png>`_.
  * What components does kdenlive use?

  In effect Kdenlive is a front end to melt - also known as MLT. The MLT video framework  relies on the FFMPEG project. Kdenlive writes sh.mlt XML files that code the edit points and transitions and it then calls /usr/bin/kdenlive_render and /usr/bin/melt to render the video.

Introduction
============


**Kdenlive** is an acronym for |kde_org| **N**\ on-\ **Li**\ near **V**\ ideo **E**\ ditor.


It is a free software (|gpl_licensed|) primarily aimed at the Linux platform, but it also works on BSD\ [1]_  as it relies only on portable components (|qt| and |mlt|). Windows versions are also available, with some drawbacks. See :ref:`troubleshooting-windows_issues` for more information. A port on MacOS is also available.

Through the MLT framework **Kdenlive** integrates many effects for video and audio processing or creation. Furthermore, **Kdenlive** brings a powerful :doc:`title editor </titles_and_graphics/titles/titles>`, a :doc:`subtitling </effects_and_filters/subtitles>` feature with AI-supported :doc:`speech to text </effects_and_filters/speech_to_text>` conversion, :ref:`nested timelines <sequence>` (new in version 23.04), :ref:`animation <add_animation>` support through Glaxnimate integration (new in version 22.08) and thus can be used as a complete studio for video creation. Check out :doc:`/more_information/whats_new` for the most recent feature additions.



Video editing features
----------------------

* Multitrack editing with a timeline and virtually unlimited number of video and audio tracks, plus the ability to split audio and video from a clip in multiple tracks

* 3-point editing

* Non-blocking rendering. You can keep working on a project at the same time a project is being transformed into a video file

* Dozens of effects and transitions that can be used with ease and even saved as custom effects with their settings for use in other projects

* Keyframeable effects with linear or smooth curves (more to come in future versions)

* Simple tools for easy creation of color clips, text clips and image clips

* Automatic :ref:`clips` creation from pictures directories, with crossfade transitions among the images

----------------------------

.. lifted from https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kdenlive/What_Kdenlive_is

  +  SNOW lossless codec
  +  Ogg vorbis, etc ...
