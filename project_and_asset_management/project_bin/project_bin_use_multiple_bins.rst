Multiple Bins
-------------

.. .. versionadded:: 21.12
   .. versionchanged:: 24.05

Folders are a good way to stay organized but they are tied to the Project Bin. If you need more flexibility you can create various bins from :ref:`folders <create_folder>` you have created. The advantage of multiple bins is that you can un-dock them, move them around your workspace, change the sequence in the dock area, and even move them to a second (or third) monitor.

      Turning folders into bins

   Right-click the folder name and choose :guilabel:`Open Current Folder In New Bin`.

   A bin can be closed either by clicking the |window-close|\ :guilabel:`Close Current Bin` icon the the bin toolbar, opening the |application-menu|\ :guilabel:`Options` menu and selecting :guilabel:`Close Current Bin` (you must be in the bin), or by selecting the :menuselection:`Menu --> View --> Project Bins` and un-ticking the respective bin in the list.

      Additional icons in the toolbar

   Note the additional icons in the toolbar of the bin.

   |go-up|\ :guilabel:`Go up` (keyboard shortcut :kbd:`Alt+UP`) goes up one level in the current bin.

   |window-close|\ :guilabel:`Close Current Bin` closes the current bin.
