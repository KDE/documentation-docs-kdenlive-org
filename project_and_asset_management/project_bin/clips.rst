Add Clip or Folder
==================

Clips in the context of the Project Bin are all external assets that are imported into Kdenlive. That includes **videos**, **audio files**, **images**, and :file:`.json` **animations**, as well as Krita image archives.

For other asset types see :doc:`title clips</project_and_asset_management/project_bin/title_clip>` and :doc:`template titles</project_and_asset_management/project_bin/template_title>`, :doc:`color clips</project_and_asset_management/project_bin/color_clip>`, :doc:`animation</project_and_asset_management/project_bin/animation>`, and :doc:`image sequence</project_and_asset_management/project_bin/image_sequence>`.

In the project bin toolbar click the |kdenlive-add-clip|\ :guilabel:`Add Clip or Folder` button, or double click an empty space in the project bin. This brings up the **Add Clip** Dialog where you can choose video, audio, animation, or still image files (individually or as an :doc:`image sequence</project_and_asset_management/project_bin/image_sequence>`) to add to your project.

.. hint:: 
   Of course, you can also drag and drop files into the project bin from your OS file manager of choice.
