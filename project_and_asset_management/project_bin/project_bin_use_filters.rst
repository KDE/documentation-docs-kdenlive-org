Using Filters
-------------

Filters are an easy way to quickly narrow down assets by tag, rating, type, or whether or not they are being used in the timeline.

.. .. versionchanged:: 23.1

.. container:: clear-both

   .. figure:: /images/project_and_asset_management/project_bin_filter.webp
      :width: 334px
      :figwidth: 334px
      :align: left
      :alt: project_bin_filter

      Filtering options
      
   :1: Category *Tags*

   :2: Category *Rating*

   :3: Category *Usage*

   :4: Category *Type*

.. rst-class:: clear-both


Filters are applied in an OR way between objects of the same category, and in an AND way between different categories.

.. rubric:: Example

.. container:: clear-both

   .. figure:: /images/project_and_asset_management/project_bin_filter_example.webp
      :width: 334px
      :figwidth: 334px
      :align: left
      :alt: project_bin_filter_example

      Filtering options
      
   This filter setting shows all assets that have a *red* OR *blue* tag, AND have a rating of *4 stars*, AND are *unused*, AND are an *AV Clip* (file with video and audio streams) OR a *Mute Video* (file with only a video stream).

.. rst-class:: clear-both

If filter criteria have been set, the filter icon in the project bin toolbar changes background color. Filter **on**: |filter-on| - filter **off**: |filter-off|
