Searching the Project Bin
-------------------------

You can search by name for any asset in the Project Bin.

.. container:: clear-both

      Searching the Project Bin

   Enter the search term into the :guilabel:`Search` field. Kdenlive will start filtering the asset list immediately and continue adjusting the search results as you type.

   Searching takes the entire filename including any suffixes (e.g. :file:`.ac3`) into account.

.. rst-class:: clear-both

.. note:: 
   Searching takes place only in the current view. If you want to search in folders you must open the folder first.
