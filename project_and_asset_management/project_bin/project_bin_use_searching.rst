Searching the Project Bin
-------------------------

The Project Bin is where all your assets are. Depending on the size of your project that list can quickly become confusing and difficult to work with. Kdenlive has several features to manage the bin's content.

      Searching the Project Bin

   Enter the search term into the :guilabel:`Search` field. Kdenlive will start filtering the asset list immediately and continue adjusting the search results as you type.

   Searching takes the entire filename including any suffixes (e.g. :file:`.ac3`) into account.

.. note:: 
   Searching takes place only in the current view. If you want to search in folders you must open the folder first.
