      The Project Files dialog window

   :guilabel:`Clips used in project` shows the total number of clips in the timeline. If it is greater than the number of :guilabel:`Project files` it means that you have used project files more than once.

   :guilabel:`Unused clips` shows the number of project files in the project bin that have not (yet) been used in the timeline.
