Archiving
=========

The Archiving feature (:menuselection:`Project --> Archive Project`, see :ref:`project_menu`) in **Kdenlive** allows you to copy all files required by the project (images, video clips, project files,...) to a folder, and alternatively to compress the whole into a :file:`tar.gz` or a :file:`zip` file.

   Archiving the project

Archiving changes the project file to update the path of video clips to the archived versions.

This can be useful if you finished working on a project and want to keep a copy of it, or if you want to move a project from one computer to another.

      :figwidth: 360px
      :align: left
      :alt: open_archived_project

   The resulting tar.gz or zip file can be opened directly in **Kdenlive** with :menuselection:`Menu --> File --> Open`, then switch file ending to :guilabel:`Archived Project`.

      :figwidth: 360px
      :align: left
      :alt: open_archived_project_target

   Kdenlive will extract the archive to a location you specify before opening it.

      :alt: open_project_missing_files

   If you have archived the project with the option :guilabel:`Archive only timeline clips`, **Kdenlive** will ask what it should do with the not archived clips.
