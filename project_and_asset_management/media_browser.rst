Media Browser
=============

.. .. versionadded:: 21.04.0
  
The Media Browser allows you to easily navigate through your file system. You can enable it from the :doc:`View</user_interface/menu/view_menu>` menu.

The main advantage of using the Media Browser is the ability to drag clips not only to the project bin but also directly into the timeline. Make sure that when you drop a clip to the timeline there is enough space and a valid video/audio track combination available.
