Patterns
========

Patterns are, like templates, re-usable collections of objects. Any object you can add to a title and any group of objects can be saved as a pattern and added to a title clip.

   The Patterns tab
   
Select any object or a group of objects in the title editor workspace, click on the :guilabel:`Patterns` tab, and then on the |list-add|\ :guilabel:`Add pattern` button.

To bring a pattern into a title clip, double-click on the respective pattern.

To delete a pattern, select it and click the |list-remove|\ :guilabel:`Delete pattern` button.

Click on |edit-delete| to delete all patterns.

Use the slider to change the size of the patterns' thumbnails.

.. warning:: 
   Deleting a pattern or all patterns at once takes place immediately and without warning message! And it cannot be undone! Use with caution!
