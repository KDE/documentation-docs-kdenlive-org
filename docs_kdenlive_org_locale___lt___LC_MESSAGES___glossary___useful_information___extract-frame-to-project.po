"If you happen to work a lot with still images from your video source "
"material in your Kdenlive project, then you may like the new :guilabel:"
"`Extract Frame to Project`, scheduled to debut in Kdenlive 16.12.0. Instead "
"of the tedious mill of extract clip, thinking of a usable image filename "
"other than adshsgfg.png, then finding this file again to add it to your "
"project … simply let Kdenlive propose a suitable filename, click OK, and "
"you’re set."

"The clip and project monitors now have a new context menu item :guilabel:"
"`Extract frame to project`, in addition to the existing :guilabel:`Extract "
"frame`. This new menu item not only extracts the currently shown frame, but "
"also adds it automatically to your project."

"You’ll still see the :guilabel:`Save Image` dialog, but there’s additional "
"convenience: Kdenlive now proposes an image filename. This bases on either "
"(in the clip monitor) on the clip name, or (in the project monitor) on the "
"project filename. To avoid filename clashes when extracting multiple frames "
"from the same source clip or project, Kdenlive neatly adds the frame number. "
"So, when extracting frames from your clip named `coolclip.mp4`, the "
"suggested image names are like `coolclip-f42.png`, and so on. Of course, you "
"can still use your own filenames as before. But you’ll probably soon start "
"to like just forgetting about filenames, as it is so convenient to focus on "
"content, not clip names."

"On purpose, Kdenlive **does not** switch to the project bin. This way, you "
"can focus on extracting the required still images from a source video clip, "
"without loosing context all the time. In contrast, with the exiting :"
"guilabel:`Extract frame`, you need to add the extracted still images at some "
"time, so you need to switch to the project bin, loosing the context on your "
"source clip."
