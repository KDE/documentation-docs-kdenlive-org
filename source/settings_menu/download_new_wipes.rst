This feature allows you to download and install files that can be used as Wipe files in the :ref:`wipe` transition.  These files are greyscale images in the pgm format. 

If you have your own wipe files that you would like to share with the community you can upload them to `store.kde.org <https://store.kde.org/browse/cat/185/>`_ which should make them available from this *Download New Wipes* function.
