.. _find_next:

Edit Menu - Find Next
=====================

.. contents::




This feature is only enabled while an :ref:`find` operation is in progress and only after a successful match has been found.  If you have the same clip used more than once in the timeline or you have multiple clips with similar names, you can find the additional occurrences of those clips using this feature. Once you get your first match using :menuselection:`Edit --> Find`, you can click :menuselection:`Edit --> Find Next` (or better yet, the default keyboard shortcut **F3**, since you've only got five seconds to execute it!) and the cursor will move to the next clip(s) that contain a match for the characters you typed.
