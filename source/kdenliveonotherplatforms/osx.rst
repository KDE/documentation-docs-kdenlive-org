Kdenlive on OS X
================

.. contents::




* *Kdenlive** and **MLT** can theoretically compile and run under Mac OS X, but there are several issues at the moment. The progress is tracked on `this issue <https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive/-/issues/993>`_. If you have experience with building software for macOS, please help us!


Very old packages are available from the `MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/>`_ project.
