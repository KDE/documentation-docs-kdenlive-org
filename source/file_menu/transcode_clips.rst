Use this to convert a video or audio clip from one codec/format to another. 


Choose one source file or multiple source files and a profile that represents the desired destination codec/format. Optionally change the destination path and file name and hit :menuselection:`Start`. Otherwise, hit :menuselection:`Abort` to close the windows.


Transcoding a clip should be faster than loading the clip into the timeline and re-encoding it into a different format.


* :menuselection:`Add clip to project` controls if after the conversion, the new clip is added to the :ref:`project_tree`.


* :menuselection:`Close after encode` Uncheck this checkbox if there is the need to convert to another format after the conversion.
