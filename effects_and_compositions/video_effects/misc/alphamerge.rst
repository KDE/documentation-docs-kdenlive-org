.. _effects-alphamerge:

Alphamerge
==========

This effect/filter adds or replaces the alpha component of the primary input with the grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with :ref:`effects-alphaextract` to allow the transmission or storage of frame sequences that have alpha in a format that does not support an alpha channel.

The effect works like a switch and does not have keyframes.
