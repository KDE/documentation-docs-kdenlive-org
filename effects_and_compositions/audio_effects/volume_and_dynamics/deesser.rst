.. rubric:: Notes

De-essing is the process of trying to eliminate certain high frequency sounds created by the human voice when saying "s", "z", "ch", "j", and "sh". These so-called sibilances range between 2 and 10kHz and are dependent on the individual's pitch. They can cause problems and may be perceived as irritable to the ear when due to compression, microphone choice, recording technique, or simply the way the individual forms those consonants excessive sibilances are produced.
