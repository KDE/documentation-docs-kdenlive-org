.. _vectorscope_MLT:

Analysis and Data - Vectorscope
===============================

.. contents::

This is the `Frei0r vectorscope <https://www.mltframework.org/plugins/FilterFrei0r-vectorscope/>`_ MLT filter.

Displays the vectorscope of the video-data.

In ver 17.04 this is found in the :ref:`analysis_and_data` category of Effects.

It is recommended to use the vectorscope from :ref:`vectorscope`, because the effect *Analysis and Data - Vectorscope* is not correct - it uses a graticule from an analog NTSC vectorscope, but equations from digital video.
