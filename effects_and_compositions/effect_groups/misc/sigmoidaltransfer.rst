This is the `Frei0r sigmoidaltransfer <https://www.mltframework.org/plugins/FilterFrei0r-sigmoidaltransfer/>`_ MLT filter by Janne Liljeblad.

Desaturates image and creates a particular look that could be called Stamp, Newspaper or Photocopy.

Two parameters:

**Brightness**: Controls Brightness of image. Range 0 to 1.

**Sharpness**: Controls sharpness of transfer. Range 0 to 1.

Both parameters default to 0 in **Kdenlive** - which is unfortunate because this results in a totally black frame. You need to have numbers above zero to see the effect.
