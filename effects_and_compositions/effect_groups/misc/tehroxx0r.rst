This is the `Frei0r tehroxx0r <https://www.mltframework.org/plugins/FilterFrei0r-tehroxx0r/>`_ MLT filter.

Something videowall-ish.

The effect might not show up during preview but it does appear in the rendered file.

This effect has one parameter – *interval* – with a range from zero to 1. This parameter controls the number of small video frames which appear around the border and how frequently they flash. Higher number = fewer frames and slower flashing.
