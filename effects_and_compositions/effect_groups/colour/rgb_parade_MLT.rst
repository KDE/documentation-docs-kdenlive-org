RGB Parade
==========

.. contents::

This is the `Frei0r rgbparade <https://www.mltframework.org/plugins/FilterFrei0r-rgbparade/>`_ MLT filter.

In ver 17.04 this is found in the :ref:`analysis_and_data` category of Effects.

Displays a histogram of R, G and B components of the video data.

This is different from the :ref:`rgb_parade` from the View Menu because the Effect version writes the histogram into the output video whereas the View Menu version just displays the histogram widget in the application while you preview your project.
