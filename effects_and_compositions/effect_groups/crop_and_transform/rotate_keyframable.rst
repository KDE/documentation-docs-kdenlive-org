  :alt: Rotate Keyframeable example

The units of rotation are tenths of a degree; e.g., 1800 = 180 degree rotation.

**Rotate X** rotates the frame in the plane of the screen.

**Rotate Y** and **Rotate Z** create the illusion of 3D rotation when used dynamically with keyframes.

The difference between **Rotate Y** and **Rotate Z** is that the apparent rotation in **Rotate Y** appears to be around a horizontal axis. The rotation in **Rotate Z** appears to be around a vertical axis.
