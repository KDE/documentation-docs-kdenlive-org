"When it comes to color correction and color grading, Lift/Gamma/Gain (LGG) "
"is the standard tool in all professional video editor applications. It is "
"very much worth it to familiarize yourself with it because it is the one-"
"stop-shopping tool to improve almost everything to do with colors in a "
"video. Even complex and complicated lighting situations (for example, "
"lighting with different color temperatures) can be tackled because the tool"
"\\ [1]_ allows you to independently improve or creatively adjust shadows "
"using *Lift*, mid-tones using *Gamma* and highlights using *Gain*."

"LGG does not do anything automatically, however. You have to adjust "
"everything yourself, and - most importantly - know and understand where and "
"how to change colors. In order to make it a bit easier, LGG uses color "
"wheels instead of just abstract values for the primary colors R (red), G "
"(green) and B (blue), so you can see what you are doing."

"The first task is to find out what tint the image has. Then you move the "
"circle in the center of the color wheel into the opposite direction of the "
"perceived tint. The further away from the center the bigger the change. And "
"sometimes it helps to overdo it a bit just to see the difference between the "
"correct and the wrong color tone."

"It is recommended to start with the midtones (*gamma*). After that you may "
"need to use *gain* to slightly adjust the highlights, usually into the same "
"direction as the midtones. And that's about it most of the time. You can "
"leave the shadows as is, more often than not."

"This sounds - and essentially is - rather simple and straightforward. The "
"difficult part is to correctly judge the tint of the image. In case you did "
"not judge it correctly you can reset your changes either individually using :"
"kbd:`RMB` or :kbd:`MW` in the respective color circle or the slider, or "
"reset the entire effect by clicking on |adjustlevels|\\ :guilabel:`Presets` "
"and selecting |view-refresh|\\ :guilabel:`Reset Effect`. You can check the "

"LGG is rather intuitive and easy to use. But make no mistake, it takes a "

"You may notice that moving the circle towards a color (e.g. (R) red) **does "
"not increase** the value for that color but **reduces** the values of the "
"opposite colors (e.g. (G) green and (B) blue). This is on purpose because it "
"avoids clipping which can happen fairly quickly and easily when increasing "
"the value of a color. That way you can focus on the colors and their changes "
"without worrying about overamplifying the respective color channel. This "
"said, moving the circle by definition makes the image darker which needs to "
"be compensated by using the corresponding slider. It applies to all three "
"primary colors (R, G, and B) equally and lifts or lowers their brightness. "
"Make sure not to exceed the value of 255 (maximum brightness), otherwise you "
"will lose tonal information."

"Instead of using the color wheels you can change the values for R, G, or B "
"directly by either entering a value, or by :kbd:`LMB` on the respective "
"color value and using the :kbd:`MW` (mouse wheel) to change the values in "
"0.010 increments. Holding :kbd:`Ctrl` while turning the wheel increases the "
