"Video transition is a post-production technique to connect shots (clips) and "
"tie them together into a cohesive and polished storyline. Depending on what "
"mood or tone you want to convey, suggest passage of time, or tell different "
"parts of the story or even show parallel story line, different transitions "
"can and should be used. It is part of the creative process of film making."

"In Kdenlive, transitions are part of :doc:`compositions <compositions>`. "
"After all, you are compositing two clips albeit for a different purpose. But "
"the workflow is very similar. And because transitions are added as "
"compositions, the two terms are often used interchangeably. Just keep in "
"mind that they are used for different purposes in video editing."

"Available transitions range from built-in presets to wipes with different "
"methods and the ability to use your own greyscale images in :file:`.pgm` "
"(Portable Grey Map) format. Most wipes (and the same applies to Dissolve and "
"Luma) are essentially greyscale images under the hood. During the "
"transition, the composition track\\ [1]_ will be displayed in the darkest "
"part of the wipe image first; if the wipe transition is inverted, the "
"composition track will become visible in the brightest area of the wipe "
"image first."
