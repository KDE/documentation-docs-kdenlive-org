"the Auto Mask effect calculates. You do not need to follow the method "
"described below to generate an Auto Mask that will obscure faces. The "
"instructions in the above video should be enough. Nor can you use the method "
"described below to improve the tracking of the mask created by the Auto Mask "

"Checking the :guilabel:`Limit keyframe number` checkbox in the \"Import "

"feature if you want to manually edit the keyframes that are imported because "
"it allows you to limit the number of keyframes you will need to manually "
"edit. If this checkbox is not checked then you import a keyframe for every "
"frame that is in the source clip."
