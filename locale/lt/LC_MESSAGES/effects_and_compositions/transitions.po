"Wipes are greyscale images in :file:`.pgm` (Portable GreyMap) format, and "
"during the transition the composition track will be displayed in the darkest "
"areas of the wipe image first. If the wipe is inversed, the composition "
"track will become visible in the brightest areas of the wipe image first "
"instead. You can download more wipes (by clicking the download button in the "
"wipe composition properties) or create your own and load them by clicking "
