"The next scope (after the :ref:`Histogram <scopes-histogram_working>` and "
"the :ref:`Waveform and RGB Parade <scopes-waveform_and_rgb_parade>`) we want "
"to discuss in more detail is the **Vectorscope**. This is actually the most "
"interesting scope because it is quite different from the other ones and, "

"There is one simple thing that makes the Vectorscope so special: It uses a "
"color space different than RGB. That sounds unspectacular but it is not. The "
"previous scopes allow you to determine which brightness values exist in your "
"image, the Vectorscope shows which colors there are."

"The Vectorscope supports two different color spaces: :term:`YUV` and :term:"
"`YPbPr`. Both of them have the *Y* in common, something you know from "
"before: It is the *Luma component* (Rec.601 in both cases). This, amongst "
"others, comes from black/white TV. When Color TV was introduced, some people "
"actually recognized that not everybody would immediately trash his old b/w "
"TV and buy a new one, so they still sent the b/w signal, but with two "
"additional channels: The blue difference and the red difference (to :term:"
"`Luma`), called U and V. For more details look at the image with its "
"individual YUV components on the Wikipedia page about |yuv|."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tips_and_tricks/scopes/vectorscope_working.rst:57

"The other color space, :term:`YPbPr` or its digital counterpart :term:"
"`YCbCr` respectively, are similar. If you switch between the two color "
"models in the Vectorscope (via the context menu) you will notice that the "
"colors are slightly shifted. YCbCr is used basically everywhere in digital "
"video."

"So, what the Vectorscope does: It calculates the Luma value of a pixel, then "
"calculates the blue difference/red difference values. Then it throws the "
"Luma value away. Why is that? It is because the Vectorscope is 2-"
"dimensional. The blue difference is on the horizontal axis, the red "
"difference is on the vertical axis. (There actually are three-dimensional "
"vectorscopes which put the Luma component on the third axis!)"

"the further away it is from the middle, the higher its saturation aka. "

"Here, the blue and red values were adjusted such that there is some padding "
