"You have installed the codecs after **Kdenlive's** installation. To force "

"The codecs are not available on your system. **Kdenlive** uses the codecs "
"from your **FFmpeg** or **Libav** library. Due to licensing issues, some "
"distributions do not provide all codecs by default and you might need to "
"install an extra package. On Ubuntu/Mint for example, you must install a "
"package called libavcodec-extra-xx. After that, check the codecs again as "
"explained in the first step."

"Last possibility is that your **FFmpeg** or **Libav** version is buggy and "

"`Settings --> Configure Kdenlive` and check the :menuselection:`Bypass codec "
