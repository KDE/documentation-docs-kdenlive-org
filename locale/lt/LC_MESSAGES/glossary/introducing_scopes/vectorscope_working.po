"The last scope (after the :ref:`Histogram <histogram_working>` and the :ref:"
"`Waveform and RGB Parade <waveform_and_RGB_parade>`) that is new to kdenlive "
"0.7.8 is the **Vectorscope**. This is actually the most interesting scope "

"There is one simple thing that makes the Vectorscope so special: It uses a "
"color space different than RGB. That sounds unspectacular, but it is not. "
"The previous scopes allow you to determine which brightness values exist in "
"your image, the Vectorscope shows which colors there are."

"The Vectorscope supports two different color spaces: *YUV* and *YPbPr*. Both "
"of them have the *Y* in common, something you know from before: It is the "
"*Luma component* (Rec.601 in both cases). This, amongst others, comes from "
"black/white TV. When Color TV was introduced, some people actually "
"recognized that not everybody would immediately trash his old b/w TV and buy "
"a new one, so they still sent the b/w signal, but with two additional "
"channels: The blue difference and the red difference (to Luma), called U and "
"V. So that is how `YUV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV>`_ works (please "
"take a look at the image in its YUV components on the linked Wikipedia page)."
msgstr ""

"The other color space, `YPbPr <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YPbPr>`_ or its "
"digital counterpart `YCbCr <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr>`_ "
"respectively, are similar. If you switch between the two color models in the "
"Vectorscope (via the context menu) you will notice that the colors are "
"slightly shifted. YCbCr is used basically everywhere in digital video."

"So, what the Vectorscope does: It calculates the Luma value of a pixel, then "
"calculates the blue difference/red difference values. Then it throws the "
"Luma value away. Why that? It is because the Vectorscope is 2-dimensional. "
"The blue difference is on the horizontal axis, the red difference is on the "
"vertical axis. (There actually are three-dimensional vectorscopes which put "
"the Luma component on the third axis!)"
