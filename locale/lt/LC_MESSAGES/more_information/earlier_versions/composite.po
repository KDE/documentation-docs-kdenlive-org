"The Composite transition combines the video data from two video tracks into "
"one. This transition is used in combination with Alpha Channel information "
"supplied by one of the :ref:`effects-alpha_mask_keying` or by the use of a :"
"doc:`/compositing/transitions/composite_transitions`. This Alpha Channel "
"data describes how the data from the two video tracks should be combined. "
"Until you define some alpha channel data using an :ref:`effects-"
"alpha_mask_keying` or a Wipe File, changes in the Composite transition "
"settings will have no visible effect."

"Note: The disadvantages of the **Composite** transition are: luma bleed, and "
"less precise position control. When compared to **Affine**, the "
"**Composite** transition, it does not support rotation or skewing but it is "
"much faster, albeit at the cost of luma bleed."
