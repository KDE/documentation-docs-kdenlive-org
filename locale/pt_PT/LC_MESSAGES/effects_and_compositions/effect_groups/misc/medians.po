msgid "Median is a quite popular non-linear filter in image processing. Most often it is used to remove impulsive noise, like \"salt &  pepper\" noise, \"dead\" and \"hot\" pixels, dirt on film, etc. This is because it behaves kind of \"inversely\" compared to linear denoisers. The more a bad pixel stands out from the surrounding area, the bigger residual it will leave with a linear filter - but the more probably it will be eliminated by the median."

msgid "The down side is that the median operation is quite slow. As an order-statistic filter, it is similar to sorting, that must be done for each pixel, so using a fast algorithm is very important. For the small medians, the algorithms of the type described in `this page <http://ndevilla.free.fr/median/median/src/optmed.c>`_ are used here, with some small modifications for a further slight improvement in speed. For the \"Variable size\" median, code from  [1]_  is used. The compound filters (ArceBI, ML3D, ML3dEX) are made according to the formulas given in the corresponding work<ref name=\"anil\">`Anil Christopher Kokaram: Motion Picture Restoration, Ph.D. thesis <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.36.9618&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf>`_</ref>. For more info on median filtering see `Wikipedia article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter>`_."
