msgid "This effect is used when using chroma keying (otherwise known as greenscreen or :ref:`blue_screen` effect). Its purpose is to compensate for the fact that sometimes the color from the green or blue screen reflects onto the subject and will make them a shade of blue or green - especially around the edges.  This is known as \"keyspill\".  This effect can attempt to compensate for this issue."

msgid "After some experimentation with chroma keying, it looked to me that there is no single method of key cleaning, that works in all situations, like keyspill on bright, keyspill on dark, etc. So I included several cleaning options, which can be used alone or in combination. In short, it offers three ways of pixel selection (masking), that can be combined with four types of color changing operations. The three selection / masking modes are based on:"
