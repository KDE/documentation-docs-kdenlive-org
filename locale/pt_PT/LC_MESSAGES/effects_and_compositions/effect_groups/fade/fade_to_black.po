msgid "In version 17.04 of Kdenlive you can add Fade to Black and Fade from Black effects with a single click. And you can adjust the length of the fade with a drag of the mouse. Hover over the grey rectangle that appears in the top corner at the end of the clip on the time line and a tool tip will appear saying \"Drag to Add or Resize a Fade Effect\". And if you do Drag you will add a Fade to Black or a Fade From Black effect (depending on which end of the clip you are working on)."
