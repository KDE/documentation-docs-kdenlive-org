"This effect can transform footage shot with a fisheye lens, to look like it "
"was shot with a rectilinear lens, and vice versa. It can also be used to "
"straighten the video that was shot with one of these wide angle converters, "
"which are only slightly curvy, or with a semi-fisheye camera, like the GoPro "

"Controls the amount of (de)distortion applied to the video. It controls the "
"ratio of fisheye focal length to image half diagonal, but in an nonlinear "
"inverse way, to make the control more \"comfortable\". It can be adjusted "
"beyond \"reasonable\" values (which differ between the mapping function "
"types), to produce some looney effects. When exploring this range, and the "
"image disappears, check the scaling, could be that the image became too big "
"or too small to see. For some unreasonable values the image might indeed "
"disappear, when there are math overflows or imaginary results... (types 1 "
"and 2 are more prone to image vanishing). Anyway, when working in the "
"\"special effect\" range, it is always worth to try manual scaling. If the "
"video contains zooming through a curvy wid angle adaptor, the needed amount "
"will vary. In this case use keyframing."
