msgid "This effect blurs the clip by applying a Gaussian function (known from statistics as an expression for the normal distribution). By default, all :term:`planes<plane>` will be affected but by setting the blur effect to different planes (e.g. red, green or blue) interesting artistic effects can be achieved. :guilabel:`Sigma` determines the strength of the blur."
