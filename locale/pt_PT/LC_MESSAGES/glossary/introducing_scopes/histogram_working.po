"When the Histogram receives an updated image from one of the monitors, each "
"of these pixels consist of a Red, Green, and Blue component. Each of these "
"values lies within a range of 0 and 255, which are the numbers you can "
"represent with one Byte. 0 means that the component is not shining at all (i."
"e. it is black), 255 means that it is shining as bright as possible."

"Most pixels are dark, according to the Luma component (white). Though there "
"is no total black: Notice that the Luma component shows «min: 8». "
"Nevertheless, the blue component does reach 0. This means that the darkest "
"pixels are still slightly orange and didn't lose all color information yet."

"There is quite some clipping. A lot of R values are sticking at the very "
"right, at 255. Having a peak at 255 usually means that we lost information "
"because some regions were too bright for the camera sensor with the current "
"sensitivity settings. This could have been solved by lowering the "
"sensitivity, but then the book and nearly everything else would be black. In "
"this case the candles cause the clipping. (Not too bad here, because the "
"lost detail isn't important for the image.)"

"The RGB components also show very well that the shadows are not neutral grey "
"but orange, otherwise the color heaps on the left would, as in the gradient "
"histogram above, have their center at the same position. There isn’t a lot "
"to correct here, what could be done is raising the shadows with a Curves "
