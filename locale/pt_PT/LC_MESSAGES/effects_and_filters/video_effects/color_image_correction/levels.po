"This effect/filter is very useful and important for correcting color levels. "
"This is achieved by setting the darkest areas (black level) and the "
"brightest (white level), thus adjusting contrast. With :guilabel:`Gamma` you "
"set the overall brightness. To assist in making the adjustments, the effect "
"has a built-in small histogram (see the warning below)."
