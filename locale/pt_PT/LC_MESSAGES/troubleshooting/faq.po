msgid "In effect, **Kdenlive** is a front end to `melt <http://www.mltframework.org/bin/view/MLT/MltMelt>`_ - which uses the MLT video framework. The MLT video framework relies on the FFMPEG project. **Kdenlive** writes :file:`sh.mlt` XML files that code the edit points and transitions and it then calls :file:`/usr/bin/kdenlive_render` and :file:`/usr/bin/melt` to render the video."
