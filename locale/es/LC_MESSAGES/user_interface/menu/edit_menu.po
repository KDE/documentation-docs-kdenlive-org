"This feature can be used to quickly locate a clip or clips in the timeline. "
"In order to use it, you must be in **Project Monitor** mode. Clicking :"
"menuselection:`Edit --> Find` (or the default shortcut **/**) turns on "
"\"find text as you type\" for five seconds or so. As you type, an "
"incremental search is performed which attempts to match any part of a clip "
"name to the characters you are typing. For instance, in the example shown "
"below, as you type \"0\", the timeline cursor would move to the first clip "
"on the timeline because that is the first clip that has a \"0\" in its name. "
"After you've typed \"00\", the cursor has not moved because that clip is "
"still a match. However, once you've typed \"005\", the cursor jumps to the "
"clip shown since it's the first one that has a match for all three "
"characters. The results of your search are displayed in the left corner of "
"the :ref:`status_bar`. If you pause typing for more than five seconds, the "
"\"find text as you type\" timer will expire. See `Find Next`_ for how to "
"find additional occurrences of matching clips."

"This feature is only enabled while an :ref:`find` operation is in progress "
"and only after a successful match has been found.  If you have the same clip "
"used more than once in the timeline or you have multiple clips with similar "
"names, you can find the additional occurrences of those clips using this "
"feature. Once you get your first match using :menuselection:`Edit --> Find`, "
"you can click :menuselection:`Edit --> Find Next` (or better yet, the "
"default keyboard shortcut **F3**, since you've only got five seconds to "
"execute it!) and the cursor will move to the next clip(s) that contain a "
"match for the characters you typed."
