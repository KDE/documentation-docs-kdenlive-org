"The interface is divided into many sections. The menu is on top and then on "
"the left you can make a note about the project. All loaded clips and videos "
"are in the project tree, the second section. Third section is the Effect "
"list. You can apply many transaction effects on your video. You can always "
"watch the project preview in the last section. You can create as many audio/"
"video track as you need. This is impressive about Kdenlive. If you’re new to "
"video editing then this is very useful. You can import multiple title clips "
"inside video track.Remove/Adjust Sections"

"If you don’t want certain sections on the screen then you can simply delete "
