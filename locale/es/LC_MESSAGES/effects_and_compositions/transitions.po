"Wipes are greyscale images in .pgm (Portable GreyMap) format, and during the "
"transition the composition track will be displayed in the darkest areas of "
"the wipe image first. If the wipe is inversed, the composition track will "
"become visible in the brightest areas of the wipe image first instead. You "
"can download more wipes (by clicking the download button in the wipe "
"composition properties) or create your own  and load them by clicking the "
"folder button."
