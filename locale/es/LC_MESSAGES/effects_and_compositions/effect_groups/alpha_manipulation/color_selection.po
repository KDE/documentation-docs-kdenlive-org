msgid ""
"The **Chroma-Key** is a more advanced version of the :ref:`blue_screen` "
"effect. Chroma-Key allows for some basic feathering (by changing the **Edge "
"Mode**) and much more fine-grained control over how much &  in which way you "
"remove the background."

msgid ""
"This is better for backgrounds that have less contrast with the foreground, "
"or more complex backgrounds. For simple backgrounds (such as green, blue, "
"red or possibly black), use the :ref:`blue_screen` effect."

"Find a clip with a background (preferably multiple, or slightly complex, "
"because the \"chroma key effect\" can do easy backgrounds such as green or "
"blue). Add the Chroma-Key effect to the clip."

"After this, either chose the color using the little droplet button. Click on "
"the droplet button, and then click on the background part of the clip you "
"want to remove. Adjust the Delta sliders until the background is removed "
"correctly. This might need to experimenting. If you find it isn't removing "
"the background well, try changing the \"selection subspace\" and experiment "
"again. If you experimented and cycled through all the \"selection subspaces"
"\", and the background isn't still removed properly, then it is probably too "
"complicated for **Kdenlive** to remove. At this point, you will need to use :"
"ref:`rotoscoping`."

"If the effect took lots of time to experiment, and you will need to use this "
"effect again, then click on the three horizontal lines in the top right "
"corner, and then click **Save effect**. Give the effect a name, and save. "

"**Invert selection**: When ON (default), the selected color will be "

"**Selection Subspace** options are: RGB (Red Green Blue), ABI and HCI  (Hue "

msgid ""
"These different options yield different results. While RGB should yield the "
"sharpest and best results, sometimes (as user *themickyrosen-left* have seen "
"from experience) the other option, HCI &  ABI, can yield much better results "
"than RGB. So if RGB isn't producing good results then try on of the other "
"options."

"If the Edge Mode is set to slope, you can use the \"slope\" slider. This "

msgid ""
"\"Hard\" means there is no featuring (edges are not smooth at all). Any part "
"of the image/video is either fully opaque and fully transparent. This means "
"there will be no blue between the removed parts and the remaining parts "
"whatsoever, and this option is useful if your chroma key turned out to be "
"perfect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../effects_and_compositions/effect_groups/alpha_manipulation/color_selection.rst:78
msgid ""
"The remaining options (\"Fat\", \"Normal\" and \"Skinny\") create a gradual "

"the selected areas are filled towards the rim (AKA more featuring for fatter "
"choices). This is useful if your color selection did not turn out that well."

"**Delta XXXX:** These three parameters determine the tolerance of the chroma "
