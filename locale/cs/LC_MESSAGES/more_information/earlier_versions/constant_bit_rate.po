"When a constant bitrate (CBR) profile is selected, the :menuselection:`File "
"Size` section displays a drop down for choosing the **Video bitrate** you "
"want. This is similar to the version <=0.9.8 behaviour of **Kdenlive**. You "
"select the video bitrate you want and the video is encoded at that video "
"bitrate across its entire length."
