"Kdenlive 16.04.1 rather quietly introduced a useful new feature to be found "
"in the timeline toolbar: :guilabel:`Manage Cached Data`. It allows you to "
"see how much disk space your projects each eat up. You can then also "
"selectively clean up project-cached data when you do not need it anymore "
"after finishing a project. See also the :doc:`archiving</"
"project_and_asset_management/file_management/archiving>` feature."
