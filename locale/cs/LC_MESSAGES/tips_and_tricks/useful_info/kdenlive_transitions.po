"To some degree, Kdenlive supports (simple) compositing in its timeline. "
"Actually, even this simple compositing can get you a long way in many "
"projects (as the above screenshot may hint at). Kdenlive currently offers "
"the following (keyframable) compositing transitions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tips_and_tricks/useful_info/kdenlive_transitions.rst:109
msgid ""
"Allows to size, rotate, skew, and position. Together with keyframes, this "
"transition is really versatile. Its only drawbacks are that it is slower "
"than other complex transitions (due to the affine transformation), and it "
"does not support wipes (which only **Composite** and **Region** support in "
"this class of transitions)."

"A simple compositing transition, supporting several compositing modes. In "

"also supports keyframes."

#: ../../tips_and_tricks/useful_info/kdenlive_transitions.rst:115

"This has the functionality of both **Affine** and **Composite**: position, "

"Allows keyframed dissolves, wipes, and swipes; and all this in the same "
"transition. In contrast to **Affine**, it does not support rotation or "
"skewing. The downsides of Composite are: :term:`luma` bleed, and less "
"precise position control. When compared to **Affine**, the **Composite** "
"transition is much faster, albeit at the cost of luma bleed."

"This is a rather new transition that made its debut with Kdenlive 16.04. It "
"allows to easily composite clips onto each other (supported several "
"compositing modes), as well as to move the upper track clips. However, there "
"is neither support for scaling nor for rotation, but for dynamic opacity. "

"(transparency) compositing mode (paint) *over* - which is what probably most "

"**Composite & Transform** - whatever semi or non-transparent is in the frame "

"**Affine** - as the simple rule of thumb, transparency is solely controlled "
