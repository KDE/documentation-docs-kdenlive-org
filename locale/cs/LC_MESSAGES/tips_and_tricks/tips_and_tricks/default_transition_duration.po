"You can configure the default duration for all newly created transitions. In "
"versions prior to 16.08, all new transitions were always 65 frames long - "
"and this translated to varying default durations, depending on a project's "
"frame rate. This new configuration option should appeal to all those users "
"who work a lot with transitions."
