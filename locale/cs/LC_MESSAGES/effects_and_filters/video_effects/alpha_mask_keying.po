"filters to work with the alpha channel of source files or create masks and "
"cut-outs if needed. It forms the prerequisite for alpha compositing\\ [1]_ "
"or alpha blending or what is more commonly referred to as Chroma Keying. At "
"the end, the results are used to combine one image or video with a "
"background to create the appearance of varying degrees of transparency."
