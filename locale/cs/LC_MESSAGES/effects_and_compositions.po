"Effects and Compositions are very important components in video editing. In "
"Kdenlive, effects and compositions are essentially filters provided by |"

"compositions of its own)."

"Effects are used to change the appearance of or manipulate a clip. For "
"example, the **Transform** effect allows to scale and move the clip; the "
"**Brightness** effect changes the brightness of the clip; effects in the "
"*Alpha, Mask and Keying* category provide very specific filters for masking "
"or rotoscoping."

"Compositions are used to combine several visual elements from different "
"sources into a single video. In Kdenlive, you put the different sources into "
"tracks in the Timeline and use compositions to tell Kdenlive how to combine "
"them. For example, the **Dissolve** composition fades out one clip while "
"fading in another over a certain number of frames. That is why Compositions "
"are often referred to as Transitions. Keep in mind that while Compositions "
"are very often used to transition from one video to another they can be used "
"to create artistic and aesthetic effects when combining several clips (e.g. "
"Darken, Dodge, Burn)."
