"Median is a quite popular non-linear filter in image processing. Most often "
"it is used to remove impulsive noise, like \"salt &  pepper\" noise, \"dead"
"\" and \"hot\" pixels, dirt on film, etc. This is because it behaves kind of "
"\"inversely\" compared to linear denoisers. The more a bad pixel stands out "
"from the surrounding area, the bigger residual it will leave with a linear "
"filter - but the more probably it will be eliminated by the median."

"The down side is that the median operation is quite slow. As an order-"
"statistic filter, it is similar to sorting, that must be done for each "
"pixel, so using a fast algorithm is very important. For the small medians, "
"the algorithms of the type described in `this page <http://ndevilla.free.fr/"
"median/median/src/optmed.c>`_ are used here, with some small modifications "
"for a further slight improvement in speed. For the \"Variable size\" median, "
"code from  [1]_  is used. The compound filters (ArceBI, ML3D, ML3dEX) are "
"made according to the formulas given in the corresponding work [2]_. For "
"more info on median filtering see `Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Median_filter>`_."
