"This effect/filter is very useful and important for correcting color levels. "
"This is achieved by setting the darkest areas (black level) and the "
"brightest (white level), thus adjusting contrast. With :guilabel:`Gamma` you "
"set the overall brightness. To assist in making the adjustments, the effect "
"has a built-in small histogram (see the warning below)."

"The histogram shows the color distribution and the position of the black and "

"Recall that the black triangle shows where the black point is and how many "
"pixels of the same brightness there are; likewise for the grey and white "
"triangle. This example shows a typical soft exposure profile, and that you "
"have to adjust the **Black input level** and **White input level** to "
"improve the contrast. The rule of thumb is to move the **Black input level** "
"to where the histogram starts; similarly, you move the **White input level** "

"The triangles at the bottom, as mentioned before, determine the output "

"the dark areas reducing the contrast and taking true black out of the image "

"There was a significant gamma correction in the original video which lead to "
"shadows being drowned in black. Adjusting the black output level can help to "

"If you switch on the built-in histogram, any other scope widget (e.g. :ref:"
