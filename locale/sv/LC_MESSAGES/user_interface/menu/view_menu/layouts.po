"Lets you switch to a previously saved custom layout.  Once you load a saved "
"layout, that layout will remain the current one when starting Kdenlive until "
"you switch to another saved layout or modify the current one.  If you do "
"make changes to a custom layout after loading it and then quit Kdenlive, you "
"will not be prompted to save your changes to the named layout.  The changes "
"will be remembered and applied the next time you launch Kdenlive, but be "
"aware that you are now working with an unnamed layout.  If you like the "
"layout and want to preserve it, save it back to the original name or save it "
"as a new name."

"Kdenlive allows a great deal of freedom to customize screen layout. You can "
"choose which windows to display and where to position them.  You can resize "
"them or undock them and move them to a second monitor.  Any changes you make "
"to the layout will be automatically saved so that the next time you start "
"Kdenlive, things will look as you left them.  This is fine if you have one "
"layout that works for all your projects.  However, you may want to have "
"different layouts for different types of projects and be able to switch "
"between them as needed."
