"The difference in behavior between enabling *Export audio* versus *Export "
"audio (automatic)* can be seen in the situation where you have a video on "

"situation is shown in the screenshot below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a variable bitrate (VBR) profile is selected, the :menuselection:`File "
"Size` section displays a drop down for choosing the **Video quality** you "
"want. This quality figure is a codec-dependent number representing the "
"quality of the video that will be rendered. Generally, lower numbers mean "
"higher quality video and larger file sizes (e.g. x264, MPEG2, VPx), but some "
"codecs use opposite order (e.g. Theora). Profiles provided with **Kdenlive** "
"offer these numbers ordered from best quality (almost lossless) to lower "
"quality (still not degrading too much). The exact file size that is produced "
"can not be predicted when using the VBR method. The idea behind this is that "
"you specify a certain quality of video that you want through the entire "
"video and the encoding optimizes bitrate to give you that constant quality, "
"lowering data size for low action scenes and using more bits for high action "
"scenes."

"Example: 1min 55 seconds of 720 x 576 H.264 iPhone footage rendered at "

"select the video bitrate you want and the video is encoded at that video "
"bitrate across its entire length."
