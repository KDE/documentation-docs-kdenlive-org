"The development of Kdenlive introduces changes to the :file:`.kdenlive` "
"document format from time to time. For example, the introduction of "
"sequences (also known as nested timelines) in version 23.04 required new "

"When Kdenlive opens a project file that was created with a lower (previous) "
"version of Kdenlive, it upgrades the document version, and automatically "
"creates a backup copy of the original project file. Kdenlive tells you that "
"a backup was created and the project file was updated to the new document "
"version. In the project folder you will find a file called :file:"
"`myproject_backup.kdenlive` (where *myproject* is the name of your project "

"file format cannot be opened with lower (previous) versions of Kdenlive . "

"be opened by a Kdenlive version lower than (prior to) 23.04 (e.g. 22.12.8) "
