msgid "Alpha channels are taken into account automatically so that clips with alpha can be stacked on top of each other without the need of compositions. You can create alpha channels in clips using effects from the :doc:`/effects_and_filters/video_effects/alpha_mask_keying` category."

msgid "Click on the grey dot in the lower left or right hand corner of the clip you want to composite with the one below. The default composition **Wipe** is added (which is more a :doc:`transition <transitions>`, so you need to :ref:`change the composition type <compositing-composition_type>` to something like **Cairo Blend**)."

But you can instruct Kdenlive to use the clip in another track by changing the :guilabel:`Composition track`. Kdenlive lists all possible tracks for the composition, and they are all below the one in which the clip with the composition is. It is not possible to composite upwards."
