msgid ":menuselection:`Simple` means that it works channel-wise, no crosstalk. The off-diagonal elements of the transform matrix are zero - no color crosstalk, no color space rotation. But this should be sufficient for many tasks. For example, when shooting under tungsten light, the blue signal will not migrate into red, it will simply be too small. Amplifying the blue (and a bit of green too) should be all that is needed. Similar, an underwater shot will simply be red deficient, needing some red boost, etc."

msgid ":menuselection:`Add constant` simply shifts the RGB \"cube\" colorspace. This means, that on one end we are left with empty space, which is filled with zeros, and on the other end, values can \"fall outside\", and in this case they will be truncated to max (255). :menuselection:`Change gain` changes the size of the cube, keeping the \"black\" corner fixed, affecting predominately highlights, but the other end can still \"fall out\" and get 255 truncated. :menuselection:`Change gamma` keeps the whole cube in the same place, just stretches and squeezes its interior, so no zero filling or truncation is necessary."
