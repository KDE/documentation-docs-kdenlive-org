"You may remember from the :doc:`Vectorscope chapter <vectorscope_working>` "
"that the Vectorscope uses a color space different than RGB. In the image "
"above it is :term:`YUV`, in the image below it is :term:`YPbPr`. They both "
"share the property that the Y component represents :term:`Luma` only (i.e. "
"how bright a pixel is), and the other two components represent :term:"
"`Chroma` (colour) by expressing deviations from neutral color on the red-"
"green and yellow-blue axis. (These are complementary colours each, so mixing "
"them in equal parts results in neutral again - which is why they can be used "
"for the deviation.)"

"YUV is the standard color space for analog PAL television. NTSC, the "
"american analog TV standard, uses a color space I did not mention yet: :term:"
"`YIQ`. The special thing about this color space is that the I component was "
"chosen such that skin tones (also known as flesh tones) lie on the I line "
"(orange-blue), and it was given more than four times as much bandwidth as "
"the Q component (which represents the green-purple line; the human eye is "
"also less sensitive for changes on this line)."

"Displaying the Q and especially the I line is to help with skin tones. There "
"is a rule of thumb in post production saying that all skin tones should "
"approximately lie on the I line. If it is not, you might want to |color-"

"The simple reason for this is that our eyes are trained on skin tones, and "
"if skin tones in your video do not lie in the I line they are very likely to "
"look unnatural. There are very good picture examples in the Save our Skins "
"article mentioned above."
