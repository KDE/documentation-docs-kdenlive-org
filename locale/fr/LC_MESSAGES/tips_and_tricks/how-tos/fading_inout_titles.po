"In this short *How-to* video, we show you how to (smoothly) fade in and out "
"Kdenlive titles over a video clip, and fading from and to transparency. The "
"key to success is to use a **Composite & Transform** transition with "
"keyframes (**Affine** and **Composite** will work too). **Do not use** the "
"Fade from/to Black effects though, as these effects remove the title "
"transparency information."

"The rationale to set this keyframe to :guilabel:`Linear` is that otherwise "
"Kdenlive (MLT) calculates a smooth curve fitting to the previous and "
"following keyframe, causing the opacity value to overshoot. With a maximum "
"possible opacity of 100% you will not notice. However, when you use a "
"maximum opacity of less than 100%, then this overshooting may become visible."
