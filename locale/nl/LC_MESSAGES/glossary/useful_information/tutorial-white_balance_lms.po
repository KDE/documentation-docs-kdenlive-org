"In photography (and hence in videos and images) lighting has a profound "
"effect on the scene: from a warm orange of a candlelight to a cold blue in "
"the shadows of a row of houses or in the mountains with a clear, blue sky. "
"The human brain is capable of adjusting these color differences, and a white "
"object is perceived as white even though the lighting gives it a different "
"hue. In a sense, our brain performs an automatic white balance based on "
"objects we know are white: a piece of white paper, porcelain or a bride's "
"white dress."

"A photo or image will show a white or color-neutral object with a hue based "
"on the color of the light source(s) and the ambient light, giving it, at "
"times, a yellow, red, green or blueish tone. Of course, this does not look "
"right and needs to be corrected. Ideally, the recording equipment has been "
"set to the correct white balance before shooting the scene. Most cameras are "
"doing a pretty good job in recognizing the lighting situation and make the "
"necessary corrections automatically. But when filming, lighting may change "
"during the scene and you don't want your camera to automatically and "
"permanently adjust the white balance because this is almost impossible to "
"correct in post."

"In case your equipment did not set the white balance correctly you can use "
"the :ref:`effects-white_balance` or :ref:`effects-white_balance_lms` effects "
"to eliminate any incorrect hues. In this tutorial we are using the :ref:"
"`effects-white_balance_lms` effect. LMS stands for long, medium and short "
"and is a color space which represents the response of the three types of "
"cones of the human eye, named for the responsiveness (sensitivity) peaks at "
"long, medium, and short wavelengths."
