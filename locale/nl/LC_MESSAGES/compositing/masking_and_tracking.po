"Compositing in video editing or film making often involves making certain "
"parts of a clip transparent or cover it (making it obscure), as well as "
"track objects. :abbr:`VFX(Visual Effects)` are unthinkable without these "
"techniques."

"Kdenlive has limited but nonetheless powerful features for masking and "
"tracking. For more elaborate effects they can be combined, for example a "
"clip can be superimposed on a framed picture on a wall in another clip "
"giving the impression it is played withing the picture frame, and that even "
"though the camera is moving along that wall. This requires a lot of manual "
"effort using keyframes but it is doable."

"Masks are stored in alpha channels. Areas that are black in the mask are "
"editable in the sense that other effects can be applied or that clips in "
"lower tracks show through, the other areas are protected, meaning they are "
"not affected by effects or filter and obscure clips on lower tracks."
