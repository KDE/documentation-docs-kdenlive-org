"There are three ways to access a menu containing this option: from the :ref:"
"`project_menu` menu, the :ref:`clips` dropdown on the Project Tree toolbar "
"or by right-clicking on a clip in the Project Tree.   This menu item creates "
"a folder in the Project Tree. It is a virtual folder, not one created on "
"your hard disk.  You can use this feature to organize your Project Tree when "
"it gets very large or complex by placing clips in folders, which can then be "
"collapsed to free up space in the tree.  Existing clips in the Project Tree "
"can be moved to a folder using drag and drop.  New clips can be added "
"directly to a folder by first selecting the folder (or any clip in the "
"folder) and then choosing an add clip option from one of the dropdown menus "
"described above."
