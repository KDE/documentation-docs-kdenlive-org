"The Composite transition combines the video data from two video tracks"
" into one. This transition is used in combination with Alpha Channel"
" information supplied by one of the :ref:`alpha_manipulation` or by the"
" use of a :ref:`composite`. This Alpha Channel data describes how the"
" data from the two video tracks should be combined. Until you define some"
" alpha channel data using an :ref:`alpha_manipulation` or a Wipe File,"
" changes in the Composite transition settings will have no visible effect."

"Note: The disadvantages of the **Composite** transition are: luma bleed,"
" and less precise position control. When compared to **Affine**, the"
" **Composite** transition, it does not support rotation or skewing but it"
" is much faster, albeit at the cost of luma bleed."
