"There are three ways to access a menu containing this option: from the :ref:"
"`project_menu` menu, the :ref:`clips` dropdown on :ref:`the Project Bin "
"toolbar <project_tree>` or by right-clicking on a clip in the :ref:`Project "
"Bin <project_tree>`. This menu item creates a folder in the Project Bin. It "
"is a virtual folder, not one created on your hard disk.  You can use this "
"feature to organize your Project Bin when it gets very large or complex by "
"placing clips in folders, which can then be collapsed to free up space in "
"the tree. Existing clips in the Project Bin can be moved to a folder using "
"drag and drop. New clips can be added directly to a folder by first "
"selecting the folder (or any clip in the folder) and then choosing the :"
"menuselection:`Add Clip` option from one of the dropdown menus described "
"above."
