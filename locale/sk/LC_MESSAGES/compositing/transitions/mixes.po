#: ../../compositing/transitions/mixes.rst:26
msgid "When using :kbd:`U`, Kdenlive tries to place the transition at the most logical spot. First, if there is a clip after the selected one, the transition is put between the selected and the one right after it; if there is no clip after the selected one but one before, the transition is put between the clip before and the selected one."
