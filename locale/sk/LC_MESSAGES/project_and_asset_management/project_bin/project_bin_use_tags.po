"Tags are a good way to stay organized as they give you a quick overview of "
"the nature of your assets. You can create as many tags as you need, assign "
"different colors, and change the default tags. After you assigned tags to "
"your assets you can then quickly filter by tags making it much easier to "
"assemble the clips in the timeline and building your story."

"Kdenlive adjusts the width of the project bin widget to accommodate all tags "
"and their description. It is recommended to keep the number of tags and the "
"length of the description as small as possible to conserve valuable screen "
"real estate for other widgets (in particular the timeline and monitors). If "
"you have multiple monitors at your disposal consider undocking some of the "
"widgets and moving them off the main screen used for editing."
