"Allows you to adjust the lift (impacting mainly shadows), gain (impacting "
"mainly highlights) and gamma (impacting mainly midtones). The color wheel "
"inputs allow to control the degree to which these effects apply to the R, G "
"& B color channels. By default, the white color at the centre of the colour "
"wheel is selected, meaning the effect applies equally to all three color "
"channels. By choosing another color on the color wheel, the effect will be "
"applied on the R, G & B channels in proportion to the RGB components that "
"make up that color."
