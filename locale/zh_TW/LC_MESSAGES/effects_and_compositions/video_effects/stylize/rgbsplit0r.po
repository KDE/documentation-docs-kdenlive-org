"This effect/filter takes the red, green and blue channels in the video and "
"separates them by a given x and y amount to produce a rainbowish effect "
"similar to the Tik Tok logo. Compare the :ref:`effects-rgba_shift` effect "
"which essentially does the same but allows individual shifting of the RGB "
"and Alpha channels and has the ability to determine the edge operation. Also "
"compare the :ref:`effects-chroma_shift` effect."
