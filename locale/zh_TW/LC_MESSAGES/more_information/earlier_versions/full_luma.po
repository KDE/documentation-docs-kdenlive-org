"By default, when we import a video it is handled and displayed based on the "
"16 - 235 range. That means levels below 15 and those above 235 are "
"compressed to 0 and 255, respectively. Thus shadows get overly dark and "
"highlights saturated in the preview in Kdenlive for camera sources that are "
"full range."

"When we render out the project, those levels remain in the final video "

"For any playback on DVDs, Blu-ray, and via the likes of Vimeo or Youtube, "
"our video levels in the final rendered output should be in the 16 - 235 "

"However, we want to have full control of the levels adjustment in Kdenlive, "
"i.e. 0 - 255 into 16 - 235. Full luma option changes the handling of the "
"files and preview / scopes are based on an alternative YCbCr to RGB "
"calculation."

"By setting the full luma on, which should only be done for camera sources "
"known to be full range 0 - 255 or even 16 - 255 such as FS100, Nex5, HV20, "
"HV30 and probably many more consumer cameras. Canon and Nikon DSLR's too but "
"a little more complicated, we can export video with the levels as imported, "
"BUT and it's a big but, that is without doing any RGB operations in "
"Kdenlive, so no effects, color correction etc. If any effects are added then "
"the output will be restricted range again."
