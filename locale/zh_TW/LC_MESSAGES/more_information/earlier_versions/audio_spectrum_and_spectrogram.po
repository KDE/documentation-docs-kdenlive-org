"When recording audio. The input gain can be adjusted on the audio recorder. "
"If the gain is too high, it might record for example low talking at a good "
"volume, but clip as soon as someone rises their voice. Therefore input gain "

#: ../../more_information/earlier_versions/audio_spectrum_and_spectrogram.rst:119

"But that is not everything yet. (Actually the above point was not about "

"problem but rather an interesting variable: If you record someone's voice "
