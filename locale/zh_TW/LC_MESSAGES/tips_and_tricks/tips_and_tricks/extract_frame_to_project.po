"If you happen to work a lot with still images from your video source "
"material in your Kdenlive project, then you may like the new :guilabel:"
"`Extract Frame to Project`. Instead of the tedious mill of extract clip, "
"thinking of a usable image filename other than :file:`adshsgfg.png`, then "
"finding this file again to add it to your project … simply let Kdenlive "
"propose a suitable filename, click OK, and you are set."

"The clip and project monitors now have a new context menu item :guilabel:"
"`Extract Frame to Project`, in addition to the existing :guilabel:`Extract "
"Frame`. This new menu item not only extracts the currently shown frame, but "
"also adds it automatically to your project."

"You will still see the :guilabel:`Save Image` dialog, but there is an "
"additional convenience: Kdenlive now proposes an image filename. This is "
"based either (in the clip monitor) on the clip name, or (in the project "
"monitor) on the project filename. To avoid filename clashes when extracting "
"multiple frames from the same source clip or project, Kdenlive neatly adds "
"the frame number. So, when extracting frames from your clip named :file:"
"`coolclip.mp4`, the suggested image names are like :file:`coolclip-f42.png`, "
"and so on. Of course, you can still use your own filenames as before. But "
"you will probably soon start to like just forgetting about filenames, as it "
"is so convenient to focus on content, not clip names."
