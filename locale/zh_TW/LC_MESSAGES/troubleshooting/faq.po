":term:`Edit Mode` is a feature of the :ref:`Project Monitor <ui-"

"parameters of certain effects directly in the project monitor with the "
"mouse. For example: When you select the :doc:`/effects_and_filters/"
"video_effects/transform_distort_perspective/transform` effect a red "
"rectangle is displayed in the monitor. If you don't see the red rectangle, "
"Edit Mode is switched off. Click on the |edit-mode| icon in the project "

"Unfortunately, you cannot do this with Kdenlive. Please try |avidemux| or |"
