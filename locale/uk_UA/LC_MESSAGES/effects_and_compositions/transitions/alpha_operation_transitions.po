"The addition, addition_alpha, alpha*atop*, alpha''in*, alpha*out*, alpha "
"over and alpha*xor'' transitions all perform alpha operations between the "
"two video tracks. These transitions only have an effect if the videos on the "
"tracks have alpha channel information in them."

"The Alpha Channel information is supplied by one of the :ref:"
"`alpha_manipulation`.  This Alpha Channel data describes which regions of "
"the video track is transparent and how transparent it should be. Until you "
"define some alpha channel data using an :ref:`alpha_manipulation`  changes "
"in the alpha operation transition settings will have no visible effect."

"The alpha operation transitions define how the two different alpha channel "
"information should be combined to produce the final image. These operations "
"are implementing the operations described at Wikipedia page on `Alpha "

"In the examples below the yellow clip has a triangle alpha shape with min = "
"0 and max =618. This translates to 0% opacity outside the triangle and 61.8% "
"opacity inside the triangle. Ie the alpha channel in the yellow track say "
"show all the track underneath outside the triangle and show 38.2% of the "
"underneath track inside the triangle"
