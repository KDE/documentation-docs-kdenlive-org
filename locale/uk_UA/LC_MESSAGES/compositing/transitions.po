"Video transition is a post-production technique to connect shots (clips) and"
" tie them together into a cohesive and polished storyline. Depending on what"
" mood or tone you want to convey, suggest passage of time, or tell different"
" parts of the story or even show parallel story line, different transitions"
" can and should be used. It is part of the creative process of film making."

"In Kdenlive, transitions are part of :doc:`compositions <compositions>`."
" After all, you are compositing two clips albeit for a different purpose."
" But the workflow is very similar. And because transitions are added as"
" compositions, the two terms are often used interchangeably. Just keep in"
" mind that they are used for different purposes in video editing."

" (Portable Grey Map) format. Most wipes (and the same applies to Dissolve"
" and Luma) are essentially greyscale images under the hood. During the"
" transition, the composition track\\ [1]_ will be displayed in the darkest"
