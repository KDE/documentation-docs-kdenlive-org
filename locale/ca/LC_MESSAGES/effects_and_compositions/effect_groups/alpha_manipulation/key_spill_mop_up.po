"This effect is used when using chroma keying (otherwise known as greenscreen"
" or :ref:`blue_screen` effect). Its purpose is to compensate for the fact"
" that sometimes the color from the green or blue screen reflects onto the"
" subject and will make them a shade of blue or green - especially around the"
" edges.  This is known as \"keyspill\".  This effect can attempt to"

"After some experimentation with chroma keying, it looked to me that there is"
" no single method of key cleaning, that works in all situations, like"
" keyspill on bright, keyspill on dark, etc. So I included several cleaning"
" options, which can be used alone or in combination. In short, it offers"
" three ways of pixel selection (masking), that can be combined with four"
