"The sharpen tool is a port of `unsharp mask <"
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_masking>`_ from Mplayer. The parameters"
" are the usual ones for unsharp masking, The \"size\" means the size of the"
" blur, and the amount is how much of the blurred version gets subtracted."

"The Size parameter ranges from 0 to 1000, where 0 represents a 3x3"
" neighbourhood, 250 represents a 5x5 neighbourhood, and 1000 represents an"
" 11x11 neighbourhood. Typically values from 0-250 are a good starting point."

"The Amount parameter also ranged from 0 to 1000, and defaults to an input"
" value of 300. The default value of 300 represents a neutral input,"
" corresponding to a 0% sharpening. Increasing above 300 will increase the"
" sharpening amount, with 500 representing 100% sharpening, 700 representing"
" 200% sharpening, and 1000 representing 350% sharpening. A value of 500 (ie."
" 100% sharpening) is typically a good place to start. Reducing the input to"
" below 300 will result in a gaussian blurring of the picture, with an input"
" value of 0 representing a -150% \"sharpening\" (ie. guassian blurring)."
