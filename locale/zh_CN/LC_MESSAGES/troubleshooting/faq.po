"In effect, **Kdenlive** is a front end to `melt <http://www.mltframework.org/"
"bin/view/MLT/MltMelt>`_ - which uses the MLT video framework. The MLT video "
"framework relies on the FFMPEG project. **Kdenlive** writes :file:`sh.mlt` "
"XML files that code the edit points and transitions and it then calls :file:"
"`/usr/bin/kdenlive_render` and :file:`/usr/bin/melt` to render the video."
