"The codecs are not available on your system. **Kdenlive** uses the codecs "

"distributions do not provide all codecs by default and you might need to "
"install an extra package. On Ubuntu/Mint for example, you must install a "
"package called libavcodec-extra-xx. After that, check the codecs again as "
"explained in the first step."
