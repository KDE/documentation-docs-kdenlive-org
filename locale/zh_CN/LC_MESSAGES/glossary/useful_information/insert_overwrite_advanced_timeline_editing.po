"When inserting or overwriting some part in the timeline with some part from "
"a clip, we now face two zones, so how does this work out at all? We only "
"want to deal with three points, that is, with one zone and a point (for that "
"reason this is also sometimes termed three point editing). In consequence, "
"there are two different insert/overwrite operations:"
