"Kdenlive 16.04.1 rather quietly introduced a useful new dialog, to be found "
"in the timeline toolbar: :guilabel:`manage cached data`. This dialog allows "
"you to see how much disk space your projects each eat up. You can then also "
"selectively clean up project-cached data when you don’t need it anymore "
"after finishing a project."
