"This option fixes problems round tripping video files with luma outside of "
"the 16 - 235 8bit range. By default when we import a video it is handled and "
"displayed based on the 16 - 235 range, levels below ie: 0 to 15 and those "
"above 235 to 255 are compressed to 0 and 255, so shadows get overly dark and "
"highlights saturated, in the preview within **Kdenlive** for camera sources "
"that are full range."

"Then when we render out, those levels remain in the final video, compressed "
"shadows and saturated highlights, so there is a mismatch between the levels "
"in the video we import compared to that exported. **This only really matters "
"for round tripping to an external application**."

"For any playback on DVD's, Blu-ray and including the web like Vimeo or "
"Youtube our video levels in the final rendered output should be in the 16 - "
"235 range, otherwise we see so called 'gamma shifts', 'washed out' or "
"saturated playback depending on playback handling."

"However really we want to have control of the levels adjustment in "
"**Kdenlive** i.e.: 0 - 255 into 16 - 235 so full luma option changes the "
"handling of the files and preview / scopes are based on an alternative YCbCr "
"to RGB calculation."

"By setting the full luma on, which should only be done for camera sources "
"known to be full range 0 - 255 or even 16 - 255 such as FS100, Nex5, HV20, "
"HV30 and probably many more consumer cameras. Canon and Nikon DSLR's too but "
"a little more complicated, we can export video with the levels as imported, "
"BUT and it's a big but, that is without doing any RGB operations in "
"**Kdenlive**, so no effects, color correction etc. If any effects are added "
"then the output will be restricted range again."

"For me I use full luma all the time, it allows roundtripping a video edit "
"and maintaining levels for grading in an external application that offers "
"32bit float precision. When it's necessary to otherwise happy with "
"**Kdenlive's** SOP/SAT and scopes."
