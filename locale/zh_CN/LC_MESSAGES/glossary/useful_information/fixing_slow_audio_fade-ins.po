"Do you suffer from an unwanted slow audio fade-ins whenever starting "
"playback in the timeline or in the clip monitor, while you don’t have any "
"audio fade effects applied at all? Turns out this is some odd interference "

"Please note that the unwanted ~2 seconds audio fade-in only happens with "
"some USB audio cards, but not others. I’ve noticed when trying a Steinberg "
"UR22mkII USB audio interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using the UR22mkII in Kdenlive using the stock audio settings was "
"impossible, as the automatic fade-in made any voice over editing a complete "
"and utter fail. Curiously, the UR22mkII worked beautifully when I played "
"back audio using an Android tablet (that’s a beautiful aspect of the "
"UR22mkII: it’s designed to be used with mobile devices). For comparism, my "
"(much more bulky) Behringer QX1202USB doesn’t exhibit the strange behavior "
"even with the default audio settings in Kdenlive, or when using PulseAudio."

"And what is even more strange and surprising: at least some other software, "
