"**Timeline preview rendering is an outstanding feature of Kdenlive**. It "
"officially debuted in version 16.08. Preview rendering allows you to render "
"parts or your complete timeline in the background, so you can smoothly play "
"it back. This is especially useful when you work with complex track "
"compositions or use effects that are computationally intensive. Instead of "
"stuttering playback, you now get smooth playback. This way, you can check "
"that your timing of keyframes and effect is working out nicely. And you "
"don’t need to leave Kdenlive, as you would need when rendering your timeline "
"to an traditional video file."

"**Raw source footage**: a good example for Kdenlive’s new timeline preview "

"system easily plays this clip back at its original frame rate of 25fps. This "
"isn’t even a job for proxy clips on a decent system."

"**Now let’s get effects-heavy**. For production, we need to de-fish this "
"footage (action cams, you know). After defishing, we need some sharpening. "
