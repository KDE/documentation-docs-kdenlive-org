"To some degree, Kdenlive supports (simple) compositing in its timeline. "

"the following (keyframable) compositing transitions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/useful_information/kdenlive-transitions.rst:96
msgid ""
"**Affine** – allows to size, rotate, skew, and position. Together with "
"keyframes, this transition is really versatile. Its only drawbacks are: it "
"is slower than other complex transitions (due to the affine transformation), "
"and it doesn’t support wipes (which only **Composite** and **Region** "
"support in this class of transitions)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/useful_information/kdenlive-transitions.rst:97
msgid ""
"**Cairo Blend** – a simple compositing transition, supporting several "
"compositing modes. In addition, the opacity of the upper frames can be "
"controlled. This transition also supports keyframes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/useful_information/kdenlive-transitions.rst:98
msgid ""
"**Cairo Affine Blend** – this has the functionality of both **Affine** and "
"**Composite**: position, rotate (you can even control the center of "
"rotation!), and finally skew. And all this is keyframable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/useful_information/kdenlive-transitions.rst:99
msgid ""
"**Composite** – allows keyframed dissolves, wipes, and swipes; and all this "
"in the same transition. In contrast to Affine, it does not support rotation "
"or skewing. The downsides of Composite are: luma bleed, and less precise "
"position control. When compared to Affine, the Composite transition is much "
"faster, albeit at the cost of luma bleed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/useful_information/kdenlive-transitions.rst:100

"**Composite & Transform** – this is a rather new transition that made its "
"debut with Kdenlive 16.04. It allows to easily composite clips onto each "
"other (supported several compositing modes), as well as to move the upper "
"track clips. However, there is neither support for scaling, nor for "
"rotation, but for dynamic opacity. But keyframes are supported. In those "
"situations, use **Affine** or **Cairo Affine Blend** instead."
