"Sometimes, you may need to work in your Kdenlive projects with images stills "
"extracted from your source footage. Now that’s easy, thanks to the “extract "
"frame…” and “extract frame to project…” items in the context menu of the "
"clip monitor. See also our earlier Toolbox post Extract Frame to Project."

"Now, there’s a **gotcha** to watch out for: Kdenlive currently extracts "
"frames according to your project settings. That means: if your source "
"footage happens to be of higher resolution than your project settings and "
"even different orientation, then the extracted frame will be in project "
"frame format. In consequence, extracted frame quality might noticeably "
"differ from the same video footage when used side-by-side in your project. "
"Luckily, there’s help."

"Agreed, such footage *might* be a sign of the – rather hilarious – `Vertical "
"Video Syndrome <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA>`_ (link to "
"YouTube explanation). Or it might be the sign of an outstanding arthouse "

"To give a concrete example: recording the screen of an Android Tablet, say, "
"a Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 gives raw footage with a frame size of 1536×2048 "
"pixels with 2:3 aspect ratio (because the portrait orientation). Even when "
"recording in landscape orientation, the 3:2 display aspect ratio isn’t "
"ideal. And you may very well want to record in original resolution in order "
"to not loose later downstream during production when you may need the "
"reserve in the raw footage."

"ffmpeg seem to offer wild guesses here, maybe based on the TV color range "

"Unfortunately, if you need to work with still images extracted from such "
"source footage, then you might have already met a nasty surprise: Kdenlive’s "
"media engine MLT extracts still frames always according to the *project "
"settings*. Consider you have a FullHD 1920×1080 pixels 19:6 project. And the "
"screencast footage is 1536×2048 pixels with 2:3 portrait aspect ratio. Then "
"you end up with extracted frames of 1920×1080 pixels size with a landscape "
"16:9 aspect ratio and a lot of transparent space, but not the expected "
"1536×2048. So not only the resolution changed, but also the aspect ratio."
