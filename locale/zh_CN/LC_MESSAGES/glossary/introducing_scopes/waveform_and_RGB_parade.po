"Waveform and RGB Parade are mighty scopes. Especially the RGB Parade. "
"Correcting the exposure is easy, with these scopes you can always keep track "
"of the levels of each color component. It is also possible to do white "
"balance by adjusting blacks first and whites afterwards because the "
"horizontal axis in the Scopes correspond to the horizontal axis in the video "
"which allows to detect spots that should be neutral."
