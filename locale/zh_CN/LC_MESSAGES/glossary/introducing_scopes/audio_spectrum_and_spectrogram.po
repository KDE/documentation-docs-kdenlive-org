"all frequencies have equal loudness, you can adjust the range to display by "

"When recording audio. The input gain can be adjusted on the audio recorder. "
"(Usually. For the Nikon D90 you cannot adjust anything for example. But its "
"audio is not really usable anyway.) If the gain is too high, it might record "
"for example low talking at a good volume, but clip as soon as someone rises "
"his/her voice. Therefore input gain is usually adjusted such that the mean "
"volume and peaks do not exceed a certain limit. This limit depends on the "
"expected dynamic audio range. A common choice is −12 dB for the mean volume "
"and maximally −6 dB for peaks."

"When editing. There are multiple volume effects in kdenlive. If you raise "

"clipping in kdenlive, you actually do quite the same as when recording "

"much louder than the rest and you cannot raise it any further, then you need "

"The further away you are from the sound source, the quieter you hear it. "

"But that is not everything yet. (Actually the above point was not about "
"dampening at all but merely about wave propagation.) There is one "
"interesting aspect, which is that higher frequencies are absorbed much "
"stronger than low frequencies. Unlike the previous points this is not a "
"problem but rather an interesting variable: If you record someone’s voice "
