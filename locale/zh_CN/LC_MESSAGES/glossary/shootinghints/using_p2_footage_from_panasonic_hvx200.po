"Using footage from P2 cards is easy when you know how! The MXF files on P2 "
"cards cannot be read until you convert them with **mxfsplit**, a part of "
"**FreeMXF**. The conversion is lossless and the resulting files contain both "
"video and audio and can be edited in real time with **Kdenlive** (or "
"**Blender 2.5+**) on most computers made within the last five years or so. "
"Also, **FFMPEG** can read these files. This process is very fast because "
"there is no transcoding and so can be done in the field while shooting just "
"as fast as simply transferring the original P2 files."
