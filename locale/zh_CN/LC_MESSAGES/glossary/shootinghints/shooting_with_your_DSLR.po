"Generally Primes are preferred over zooms in video. (Some people, like me, "
"prefer it over zooms as well for photography — but this is a matter of taste "
"and of how you work.) Why that? A psychological reason is that eyes (at "
"least mine) cannot zoom either, so zooming is hardly ever used in video. The "
"technical reason is that Primes are cheaper to build whilst offering better "
"quality: Better sharpness, bigger aperture (for limiting the Depth of "
"Field). Opening the aperture gives you a very nice look. (Please also read "
"ArtInvent's comment on this.)"

"Directly related to the previous point about lenses. Shooting with an open "
"aperture works well as long as it is dark. In bright sunlight it will fail "
"because there is too much light falling on the sensor. Furthermore you are "
"forced to use a high shutter speed which makes movements look jerky; Most of "
"the time you will want to have some kind of motion blur because it looks "
"more natural to our eyes."

"The same as for shooting stills. Really? Not quite. As written above you "
"will usually want to have the shutter speed lower than for photography in "

"Also, some additional problems may arise due to the sensor being read out "

"exposure can, but need not, prevent such problems. It does if you are "
"shooting with fluorescent lamps. Shooting at high shutter speed shows wave "
"patterns from top to bottom of the screen, lowering it hides them if you hit "
"the correct shutter speed."
