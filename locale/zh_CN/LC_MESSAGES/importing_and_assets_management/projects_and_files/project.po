"When Kdenlive opens a project file that upgrades the document version, like "
"with 20.08.0 or 23.04.0, it automatically creates a backup copy of the "
"original project file. When a project was created with an older document "
"version, like Kdenlive < 20.08.0 or < 23.04.0 and you opened it, look into "
"the project folder. You should have a file called `myproject_backup."
"kdenlive`. This is a copy of the original project file before the upgrade "
"and you should be able to open it correctly either with Kdenlive 20.04.x or "
