"There may be times when you want to quickly restore your project to the "
"state it was in several changes ago. Instead of repeatedly executing single "
"undo operations, it might be more efficient to jump right to the operation "
"in question â€“ if you could easily locate it."

"That's where :menuselection:`View` > :menuselection:`Undo History` comes in. "
"It opens a dockable window which lists all the changes made to your project "
"in the order they were made. When a project file is first opened, the window "
"looks like Figure 1."

"Each operation you perform from then on gets added to the list, as shown in "

"In this example, if you wanted to undo the last three operations with one "
"click, all you have to do is click on the **Create color clip** entry and "
"those three changes will be reversed in one fell swoop.  At this point, if "
"you are unhappy with undoing those changes, you can easily redo them by "
"clicking on any of the entries which are still in the list."

"However, if you decided that reverting to that **Create color clip** entry "
"looked good and you then made another change to the project, the three "
"remaining operations that were in the list in Figure 3 will be flushed from "
"the buffer and no longer available.  They will be replaced by the new "
"operation you just performed.  See the result in Figure 4."

"Whenever you save your project, the icon that looks like a broom with the "
"red X is repositioned next to the most recent operation in the list.  Figure "
"5 shows three additional operations which were performed after the file save "
"shown by the circle.  After saving the file, you can still revert back to "
"changes which were made before the save."
