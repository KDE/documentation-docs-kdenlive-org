"The horizontal axis represents the horizontal axis in the video frame. The "
"vertical axis is the pixel luminance from 0 to 255. The brightness of the "

"In the sample screenshot below of a green screen with a shadow on it and "
"with a right edge that reveals a white wall, you can see how the scope "
"works. The circled regions labeled 1 are on the right side representing the "
"fact that there are several columns of pixels that are quite bright whitish/"
