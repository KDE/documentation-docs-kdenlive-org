":menuselection:`Space` brings up a submenu with :menuselection:`Insert "
"Space` and :menuselection:`Remove Space` options.  Inserting a space is a "
"useful feature when you want to push all the existing clips on the timeline "
"aside to make room for new clips but also want to preserve the relationships "
"among all the clips that were shifted, including their transitions."

"In addition to invoking this menu from :menuselection:`Timeline --> Space`, "
"you can also bring it up by right-clicking on an empty spot on a track in "
"the timeline.  There are a couple of important differences with how :"
"menuselection:`Insert Space` behaves, though, depending on which method you "
"choose.  First, using :menuselection:`Timeline --> Space --> Insert Space` "
"brings up the **Add Space** dialog shown in Figure 1 where the default "
"choice for **Track:** is *All tracks*."

"When you access the menu by right-clicking on a track, the same dialog "
"appears but the default is the track you clicked on.  In either case, you "
"can obviously override the default by picking another option (Figure 2).  "
"The other difference is that the insertion happens at the playhead when the "
"operation originates from the Timeline menu; it takes place at the mouse "
"cursor position when right-clicking."

"And in case you're wondering, the default **Duration** for the inserted "
"space is 65 frames, which is not configurable in the Kdenlive or Project "
"settings.  65 frames will equate to different amounts of time depending on "
"the frame rate set in your project profile.  In the example, our project's "
"frame rate happens to be 30 fps and that's why the default **Duration** "
"works out to be 00:00:02.05."

"Let's look at an example, albeit an unrealistic one, of how inserting a "
"space from the playhead position will affect clips and transitions on "
"different tracks.  In general, inserting a space will shift any clips that "
"the playhead is touching as well as all clips to the right of the playhead "
"on the affected track(s).  Transitions are a little trickier because they "
"span two tracks.  They are assumed to “belong” to the higher track "
"(regardless of the direction of the transition) and so if the playhead is "
"touching them, they will go if the higher track is included in the shift.  "
"Figure 3 shows a scenario with clips on three video tracks before inserting "
"a space.  All of the following examples assume we're starting from this "
"position."

"In Figure 4, we have chosen to insert a space on *All Tracks*.  Since the "
"playhead was touching both transitions and the color clips on tracks 2 and "
"3, it shifted them, along with all the clips to the right of the playhead.  "
"It did not shift the black clip on track 1 because it was to the left of the "
"playhead."

"In Figure 5, we chose Track 1.  The transition went because it “belongs” to "
"the black clip on track 1, but the clip itself did not go because it was to "
"the left of the playhead.  The red clip on track 1 also went because it was "
"to the right of the playhead."

"In Figure 6, we shifted the clips on Track 2.  Now the Dissolve transition "
"between tracks 1 and 2 does not shift, even though the playhead was touching "
"it, because it belongs to track 1.  The other transition does go, because it "
"belongs to the higher track 2."
