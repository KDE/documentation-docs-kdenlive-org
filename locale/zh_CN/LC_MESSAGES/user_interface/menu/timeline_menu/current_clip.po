":menuselection:`Cut Clip` performs the same operation as the :ref:`editing`, "
"but it works differently.  When the Razor tool is enabled, you can click on "
"any clip on the timeline and that clip will be cut where you clicked.  To "
"use :menuselection:`Cut Clip` from the menu or its :kbd:`Shift + R` keyboard "
"shortcut, you must first select the target clip or clip group and then "
"position the playhead where you want the cut to occur.  Figures 1 and 2 show "
"the before and after of such an action. Unlike using the Razor tool, you can "
"even cut a clip this way while it is playing (again, as long is it is "
"selected first).  If you try to perform the operation when the playhead is "
"on an unselected clip, nothing will happen."

"This option is an alternative to dragging with the mouse for changing not "

"the time values directly with spin boxes gives more fine-grained control "
"than dragging with the mouse.  A quicker way than using the menus to bring "
"up the **Duration** dialog is to simply double-click on a clip in the "
"timeline."

"Figure 3 shows an example of a 10-second clip located at the 1 minute "
"position on the timeline.  You can see that the *Crop start* and *Crop end* "
"values are blank. This indicates that 10 seconds is the full, uncut length "
"of the clip.  We can’t increase its duration (there’s just no more material "
"available) but we can crop it to remove material from the beginning, end, or "
"both."

"Figure 4 shows the result of cropping 1 second from the start and end of the "
"clip. This leaves an 8-second clip, still positioned at the 1 minute mark on "
"the timeline.  In the case of the example, we could also adjust its position "
"because there is empty space on either side of the clip.  If there happened "
"to be other clips adjacent to the selected clip, you would not be able to "
"adjust its position with this method, even if you have :ref:`editing` "
"enabled.  This is a case where dragging the clip with the mouse does have an "
"advantage."

"The examples shown above apply to video clips.  Still images, Color and "

"''Position*and*Duration'' (Figure 5)."

"Use this option to save a copy of the current clip as an XML file.  When you "
"select it, you will be presented with the **Save As** dialog, a portion of "
"which is shown in Figure 6.  The saved file is basically a proxy clip which "
"points back to the original file.  It not only references the original "
"selected clip but also stores all the properties of that clip, including any "
"effects (but not transitions) which were applied when you did the save.  The "
"saved file can be added back as a clip to the project and used on the "
"timeline like a regular video clip.  It will retain the properties of the "
"original source clip as they were when you saved them, even if you go back "
"later and modify the source clip."
