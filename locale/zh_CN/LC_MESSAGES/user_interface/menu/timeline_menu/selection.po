"The purpose of this submenu is to allow you to select multiple clips or "
"transitions on the timeline for the purpose of performing operations on all "
"of them simultaneously.  However, it should be said up front that making "
"selections this way is not very practical.  That’s because, in order to "
"select a clip or transition using this menu, you must first position the "
"playhead on it.  A much quicker and easier way is to press :kbd:`Ctrl + left-"
"click` on each clip you want to add to the selection.  The clips do not have "
"to be contiguous to be selected using this method.  If the clips you want to "
"select are all contiguous, you can press :kbd:`Shift + left-click` and drag "
"your mouse over all the clips."

"In Figure 1, three of the five clips on the timeline have been selected "
"using the  :kbd:`Ctrl + left-click` method.  At first, it might be difficult "
"to tell which clips are part of the selection because of the different "
"colors. Kdenlive indicates that a clip is selected by changing the color of "
"the filename text to white; unselected clips show the filename with black "
"letters.  So even though two of the selected clips have a light blue outline "
"and the third is outlined in a red border, they are all part of the same "
"selection (the *clipxx.MOV* filenames are all in white).  Conversely, "
"*clip03.MOV* and *clip05.MOV* are not part of the selection – their text is "
"black."

"Now that multiple clips have been selected, you can do things like moving, "
"copying, pasting or deleting all of them at once.  Or you can use the :ref:"
"`grouping` option to perform other advanced operations on the clips. Figure "
"2 shows that the selected clips from Figure 1 have been moved to another "
"track by grabbing any of the selected clips with the mouse and dragging "
"them.  Clicking anywhere outside of the selected clips will unselect all of "
"them.  Note however, that if you had used the **Group Clips** option on the "
"selections, the clips will still be grouped even though they are no longer "
"selected."

"Selecting multiple transitions works just like selecting clips.  Click on "
"the first one and then :kbd:`Ctrl + left-click` on as many others as you'd "
"like to add to the selection.  Figure 3 shows two **Dissolve** transitions "
"selected. These transitions can now be copied, moved, deleted, etc. just as "
"with clips."
