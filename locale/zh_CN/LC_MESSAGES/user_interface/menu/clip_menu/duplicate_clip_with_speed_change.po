"This feature used to be *Reverse Clip* and was available from version 0.9.6 "
"of Kdenlive. From version 17.04 it can still be used to reverse the clip - "
"by entering a speed of minus 100%. But you can create clips of other speeds "
"too. With the new version of the clip job the sound in the clip is also "
"reversed - so you can learn backwards talking!"
