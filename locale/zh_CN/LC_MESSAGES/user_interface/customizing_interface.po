"The user interface model allows you to freely adjust the different panels to "
"support your workflow. You can add :term:`widgets<widget>` to and delete "
"them from the different panels, rearrange them, change the size of the "
"panels, and save the workspace layout so you can have different layouts with "
"different widgets depending on the stage of your post-production work. For "
"example, you can have different workspace layouts for video editing, color "
"correction and sound editing. Kdenlive comes with four different workspace "
"layouts already defined. See the :ref:`ui-workspace_layouts` chapter."

"Here is a quick reminder of the different workspace panels (see :ref:"
"`user_interface`). In this section we want to focus on the panels 1 thru 4 "
"and panel #6. Panel #5 (timeline toolbar) is not really a panel by itself "
"but is part of the timeline. Panels 7 and 8 are described in more detail in "

"Kdenlive allows you to arrange these five panels in columns or in rows. You "
"define this in :menuselection:`Menu --> View --> Dock Area Orientation`. In "
"both cases the timeline panel (#4) determines what is a row and what is a "
"column. The difference is that if you select :guilabel:`Arrange dock areas "
"in columns` you can add columns to the right of the timeline that extend "
"from top to bottom. You can still add widgets above or below other widgets "
"but the right edge of the timeline will be. If you select :guilabel:`Arrange "
"dock areas in rows` you have two rows to start with. You can drag widgets "
"below the timeline to create a new row but not above the first and between "
"the first and second row. You can move widgets with a row to create new "
