"The interface is divided into many sections. The menu is on top and then on "
"the left you can make a note about the project. All loaded clips and videos "
"are in the project bin, the second section. Third section is the Effect "
"list. You can apply many transaction effects on your video. You can always "
"watch the project preview in the last section. You can create as many audio/"
"video track as you need. This is impressive about Kdenlive. If you’re new to "
"video editing then this is very useful. You can import multiple title clips "
"inside video track."

"You won't notice on the spot, but the tabs that appear on the bottom of the "
"panes aren't built in them, but change according to what panes you have "
"aggregated into that particular frame. This way you can group functions that "
"you don't expect to use simultaneously into a single place on the user "
"interface, thus reducing clutter."

"If you don’t want certain sections on the screen then you can simply delete "
"them to make other sections wider. Just click the close button on that "
"section and that section will be closed, by removing unnecessary video/audio "
"tracks and now you can organize enough space to preview your project and all "
"other necessary sections are wider."
