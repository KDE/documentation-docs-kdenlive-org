"**Waveform** and **RGB Parade** are powerful scopes. Especially the RGB "
"Parade. Correcting the exposure is easy, and with these scopes you can "
"always keep track of the levels of each color component. It is also possible "
"to do white balance by adjusting blacks first and whites afterwards because "
"the horizontal axis in the Scopes correspond to the horizontal axis in the "
"video which allows to detect spots that should be neutral."
