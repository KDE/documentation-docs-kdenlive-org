"As it turns out, Kdenlive's media engine |mlt| can exhibit some issues with "
"video footage that has a highly variable frame rate, such as between 0.001 "

"which is way off in regions with a low framerate. While this is not an issue "
"for a suitably high framerate, this causes odd results in other places. For "
"instance, user touch interaction shows up even a few seconds before the "
"interaction will appear. This is probably caused by a very low fps during "
