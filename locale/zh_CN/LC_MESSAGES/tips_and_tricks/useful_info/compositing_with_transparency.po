"**Simply spoken:** if you paint some semi-transparent pixel over another "

"The dynamic compositing transitions also feature a parameter called "

"Instead, the opacity parameter influences how the result **pixel color** "

"But when we look at how the transparency of the resulting pixel gets "

"transparency of the upper frame (B) pixel gets scaled down in reverse "
"proportion of the lower frame (A) pixel transparency. The **opacity** "

"frame (B) pixel transparency. Please see also the illustration."
