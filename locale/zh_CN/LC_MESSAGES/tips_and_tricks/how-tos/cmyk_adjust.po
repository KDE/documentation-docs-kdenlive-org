":term:`Color Correction` is an important process when dealing with footage "
"that was shot with different equipment or in different lighting conditions. "
"See also the how-to about :doc:`white balance </tips_and_tricks/how-tos/"
"tutorial-white_balance_lms>`. CMYK Adjust is an interesting filter for some "
"special tasks in color correction."

"Naturally, digital video footage uses the :abbr:`RGB (Red Green Blue)` :term:"
"`color space`. But :doc:`/effects_and_compositions/video_effects/"
"color_image_correction/CMYK_adjust` in addition has parameters (or sliders) "
"for Cyans, Magentas, Yellows, and Whites, Neutrals and Blacks."

"The effect works by changing the color intensity (or saturation) of the "
"color individually with the respective slider - all the other colors are not "
"affected. For example, you can increase or decrease the intensity (or "
"saturation) of the color *red* using the slider :guilabel:`Reds` without "
"changing other pixels (i.e. those parts of the image that are not red). Most "
"important is that neutral color tones remain unchanged. So this effect/"
"filter is very useful for reducing redishness in skin tones."

"Using the :guilabel:`Whites` slider you can make bright color tones more "
"redish (move the color tone more toward red-magenta) or blueish (move the "
"color tone more towards blue-cyan). The same applies for :guilabel:"
"`Neutrals` to change the mid-tones and :guilabel:`Blacks` for the dark tones."

"The effect works like a mask for a specific color tone but limited to one of "
"the six basic colors. The advantage is that you do not have to create a "
"precise selection and that you can directly change the intensity "
"(saturation)."

"When moving the :guilabel:`Reds`, :guilabel:`Yellows` or :guilabel:"
"`Magentas` slider to the right (increases the value) the intensity "
"(saturation) decreases; moving it to the left (decreasing the value) "
"increases the intensity (saturation). All other sliders work as one might "
"expect: higher values increase intensity (saturation)."
