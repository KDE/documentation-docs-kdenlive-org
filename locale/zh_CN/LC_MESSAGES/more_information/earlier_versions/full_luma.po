"By default, when we import a video it is handled and displayed based on the "
"16 - 235 range. That means levels below 15 and those above 235 are "
"compressed to 0 and 255, respectively. Thus shadows get overly dark and "
"highlights saturated in the preview in Kdenlive for camera sources that are "
"full range."

"For any playback on DVDs, Blu-ray, and via the likes of Vimeo or Youtube, "

"However, we want to have full control of the levels adjustment in Kdenlive, "

"HV30 and probably many more consumer cameras. Canon and Nikon DSLR's too but "
"a little more complicated, we can export video with the levels as imported, "
"BUT and it's a big but, that is without doing any RGB operations in "
"Kdenlive, so no effects, color correction etc. If any effects are added then "
