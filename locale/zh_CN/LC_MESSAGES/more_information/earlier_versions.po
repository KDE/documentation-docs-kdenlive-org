"When a variable bitrate (VBR) profile is selected, the :guilabel:`File Size` "
"section displays a drop down for choosing the **Video quality** you want. "
"This quality figure is a codec-dependent number representing the quality of "
"the video that will be rendered. Generally, lower numbers mean higher "
"quality video and larger file sizes (e.g. x264, MPEG2, VPx), but some codecs "
"use opposite order (e.g. Theora). Profiles provided with **Kdenlive** offer "
"these numbers ordered from best quality (almost lossless) to lower quality "
"(still not degrading too much). The exact file size that is produced can not "
"be predicted when using the VBR method. The idea behind this is that you "
"specify a certain quality of video that you want through the entire video "
"and the encoding optimizes bitrate to give you that constant quality, "
"lowering data size for low action scenes and using more bits for high action "
"scenes."

"Example: 1min 55 seconds of 720 x 576 H.264 iPhone footage rendered at "
"quality 15 with the H.264/AAC High Profile would produce a file size of 186 "
"Mb. Whereas rendering the same footage at quality quality 20 produced an "
"83Mb file."
