"This is the `FilterFrei0r-sopsat <https://www.mltframework.org/plugins/"
"FilterFrei0r-sopsat/>`_  MLT framework filter. It changes Slope, Offset, and "
"Power of the color components, and the overall Saturation, according to the "
"ASC CDL (Color Decision List) `reference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"

"Changing the slope means multiplying the pixel value with a constant value. "
"Black pixels will remain black, while as brighter ones will be changed. All "
"effects can be observed well when applied on a greyscale gradient and "
"looking at the RGB Parade monitor."
