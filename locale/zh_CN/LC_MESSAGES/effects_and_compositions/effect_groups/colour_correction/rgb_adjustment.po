msgid ""
"This filter is for simple manual color adjustment by RGB channel, either "
"through adding constants, or changing the channel gammas or gains."

":menuselection:`Simple` means that it works channel-wise, no crosstalk. The "
"off-diagonal elements of the transform matrix are zero - no color crosstalk, "
"no color space rotation. But this should be sufficient for many tasks. For "
"example, when shooting under tungsten light, the blue signal will not "
"migrate into red, it will simply be too small. Amplifying the blue (and a "
"bit of green too) should be all that is needed. Similar, an underwater shot "
"will simply be red deficient, needing some red boost, etc."

":menuselection:`Add constant` simply shifts the RGB \"cube\" colorspace. "
"This means, that on one end we are left with empty space, which is filled "
"with zeros, and on the other end, values can \"fall outside\", and in this "
"case they will be truncated to max (255). :menuselection:`Change gain` "
"changes the size of the cube, keeping the \"black\" corner fixed, affecting "
"predominately highlights, but the other end can still \"fall out\" and get "
"255 truncated. :menuselection:`Change gamma` keeps the whole cube in the "
"same place, just stretches and squeezes its interior, so no zero filling or "
"truncation is necessary."
