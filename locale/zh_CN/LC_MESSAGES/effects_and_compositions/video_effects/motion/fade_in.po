"Since version 17.04 of Kdenlive you can add the **Fade In** effect with a "
"single click using the fade handles (see screenshot below). And you can "
"adjust the length of the fade with a drag of the mouse. Move the mouse over "
"a selected clip in the timeline and click on the green dot in the top corner "
"at the beginning of the clip. That creates a default fade-in of 3 seconds. "
"In order to adjust the duration of the fade-in you can drag the green dot or "
"use the :guilabel:`Duration` slider in the **Fade In** effect panel in the "
"clip's effect stack."
