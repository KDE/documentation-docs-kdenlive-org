"This effect/filter allows you to adjust the lift (impacting mainly shadows), "
"gain (impacting mainly highlights) and :term:`gamma` (impacting mainly "
"midtones). The color wheel inputs allow to control the degree to which these "
"effects apply to the R, G & B color channels. By default, the white color at "
"the centre of the colour wheel is selected, meaning the effect applies "
"equally to all three color channels. By choosing another color on the color "
"wheel, the effect will be applied on the R, G & B channels in proportion to "
"the RGB components that make up that color."
