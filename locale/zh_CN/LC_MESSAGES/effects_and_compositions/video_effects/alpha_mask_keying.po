"The *Alpha, Mask and Keying* video effects category provides effects and "
"filters to work with the alpha channel of source files or create masks and "
"cut-outs if needed. It forms the prerequisite for alpha compositing [1]_ or "
"alpha blending or what is more commonly referred to as Chroma Keying. At the "
"end, the results are used to combine one image or video with a background to "
"create the appearance of varying degrees of transparency."
