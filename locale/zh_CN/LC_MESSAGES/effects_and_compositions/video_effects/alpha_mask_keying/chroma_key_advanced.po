"This effect is a more advanced version of the :ref:`Chroma Key: Basic "
"<effects-chroma_key_basic>` effect. *Chroma Key: Advanced*\\ [1]_ allows for "
"some basic feathering (by changing the :guilabel:`Edge Mode`) and much more "
"fine-grained control over how much and in which way you remove the "
"background."

"This is better for backgrounds that have less contrast with the foreground "

"guilabel:`Delta` sliders until the background is removed correctly. This "
"might need some experimenting. If you find it is not removing the background "
"well try changing the :guilabel:`Color Model` and experiment again. If you "
"experimented and cycled through all the :guilabel:`Color Models`, and the "
"background is still not removed properly then it is probably too complicated "
