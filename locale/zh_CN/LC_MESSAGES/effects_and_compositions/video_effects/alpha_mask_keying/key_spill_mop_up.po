"This effect is used in combination with chroma keying (otherwise known as "
"Greenscreen or Bluescreen). Its purpose is to compensate for the fact that "
"sometimes the color from the green or blue screen reflects onto the subject "
"and will make them a shade of blue or green especially around the edges. "
"This is known as \"key spill\". This effect can attempt to compensate for "
"this issue."

"This effect can be cascaded, but it is not possible to get the same color "
"based mask in the second instance, because the colors will be changed by the "
"first instance. To enable two operations with the same mask, each plugin "
"instance can do two operations. With transparency and edge masks, cascading "
"is a bit easier. If the hue gate and saturation threshold are not used, "
"transparency and edge masks can be exactly the same in cascaded effects."
