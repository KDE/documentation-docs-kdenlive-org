"The axes for rotation and shear are different than for moving a clip. The "
"latter uses the monitor plane: X = width or horizontal axis, Y = height or "
"vertical axis. For rotation and shear the plane is tilted by 90 degrees "
"\"into the monitor\" and rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical "
"axis. This results in the X axis coming out of/going into the monitor, the Y "
"axis being along the width of the monitor and the Z axis being along the "
"height of the monitor. See image below."
