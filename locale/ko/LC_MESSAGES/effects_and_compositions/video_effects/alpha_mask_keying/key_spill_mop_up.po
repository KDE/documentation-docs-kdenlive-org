"This effect is used when using chroma keying (otherwise known as greenscreen "
"or :ref:`blue_screen` effect). Its purpose is to compensate for the fact "
"that sometimes the color from the green or blue screen reflects onto the "
"subject and will make them a shade of blue or green - especially around the "
"edges. This is known as \"keyspill\". This effect can attempt to compensate "
"for this issue."

"After some experimentation with chroma keying, it looked to me that there is "
"no single method of key cleaning, that works in all situations, like "
"keyspill on bright, keyspill on dark, etc. So I included several cleaning "
"options, which can be used alone or in combination. In short, it offers "
"three ways of pixel selection (masking), that can be combined with four "
"types of color changing operations. The three selection / masking modes are "
