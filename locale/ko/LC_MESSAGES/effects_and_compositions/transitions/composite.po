"The Composite transition combines the video data from two video tracks into "
"one. This transition is used in combination with Alpha Channel information "
"supplied by one of the :ref:`effects-alpha_mask_keying` or by the use of a :"
"ref:`composite`. This Alpha Channel data describes how the data from the two "
"video tracks should be combined. Until you define some alpha channel data "
"using an :ref:`effects-alpha_mask_keying` or a Wipe File, changes in the "
"Composite transition settings will have no visible effect."

"Note: The disadvantages of the **Composite** transition are: luma bleed, and "
"less precise position control. When compared to **Affine**, the "
"**Composite** transition, it does not support rotation or skewing but it is "
"much faster, albeit at the cost of luma bleed."
