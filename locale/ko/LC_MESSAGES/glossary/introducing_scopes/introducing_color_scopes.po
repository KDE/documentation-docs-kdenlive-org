msgid "**Color correction.** This is a really important topic in video editing. It starts with simple stretching of the tonal range if the brightness is not ideal, goes on with white balance to ensure that white remains white and not blue, and finally ends with creating looks which make your video look unique. (Remember the blueish `Minority Report <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minority_Report_bleached.jpg>`_? The contrasty `The Departed <https://web.archive.org/web/20160328033801/http://www.wbshop.com/product/code/1000121856.do>`_?)"

When not color correcting, it should be disabled as it usually heavily impacts the performance of playback. (There is a lot of calculations going on in the scopes.)"
