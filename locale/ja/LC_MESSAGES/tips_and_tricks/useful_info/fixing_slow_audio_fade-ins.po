"Please note that the unwanted ~2 seconds audio fade-in only happens with "
"**some** USB audio cards but not others. It was noticed when trying a "
"Steinberg UR22mkII USB audio interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using the UR22mkII in Kdenlive using the stock audio settings was "
"impossible, as the automatic fade-in made any voice over editing a complete "
"and utter fail. Curiously, the UR22mkII worked beautifully when playing back "
"audio using an Android tablet (that is a beautiful aspect of the UR22mkII: "
"it is designed to be used with mobile devices). For comparison, a (much "
"bulkier) Behringer QX1202USB does not exhibit the strange behavior even with "
"the default audio settings in Kdenlive, or when using PulseAudio."
