"In photography (and hence in videos and images) lighting has a profound "
"effect on the scene: from a warm orange of a candlelight to a cold blue in "
"the shadows of a row of houses or in the mountains with a clear, blue sky. "
"The human brain is capable of adjusting these color differences, and a white "
"object is perceived as white even though the lighting gives it a different "
"hue. In a sense, our brain performs an automatic white balance based on "
"objects we know are white: a piece of white paper, porcelain or a bride's "
"white dress."

"A photo or image will show a white or color-neutral object with a hue based "
"on the color of the light source(s) and the ambient light, giving it, at "
"times, a yellow, red, green or blueish tone. Of course, this does not look "
"right and needs to be corrected. Ideally, the recording equipment has been "
"set to the correct white balance before shooting the scene. Most cameras do "
"a very good job of auto white balance when taking (single) pictures. When "
"filming, however, no auto white balance is used. That is because even in "
"constant lighting situations, the white balance automatically made by the "
"camera fluctuates when the detail changes or the filmed person even moves "
"his arm. This influences the camera's assessment and leads to color changes "
"which are very difficult to correct in post-production."

"In case your equipment did not set the white balance correctly you can use "
"the :doc:`/effects_and_compositions/video_effects/color_image_correction/"
"white_balance` or :doc:`/effects_and_compositions/video_effects/"
"color_image_correction/white_balance_lms` effects to eliminate any incorrect "
"hues. In this tutorial we are using the :doc:`/effects_and_compositions/"
"video_effects/color_image_correction/white_balance_lms` effect. LMS stands "
"for long, medium and short and is a color space which represents the "
"response of the three types of cones of the human eye, named for the "
"responsiveness (sensitivity) peaks at long, medium, and short wavelengths."

"The :doc:`/effects_and_compositions/video_effects/color_image_correction/"
"white_balance` effect works the same except that :guilabel:`Color "
"Temperature` is called :guilabel:`Green Tint` which changes the source image "
"from magenta (=0) to green (=10,000). There are cases where you may want to "
"stack both effects and play with the sliders."
