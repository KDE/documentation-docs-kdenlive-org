"Using footage from P2 cards is easy when you know how! The MXF files on P2 "
"cards cannot be read until you convert them with |mxfsplit|, a part of |"
"freemxf|. The conversion is lossless and the resulting files contain both "
"video and audio and can be edited in real time with Kdenlive (or Blender "
"2.5+) on most computers made within the last five years or so. Also, |"
"ffmpeg| can read these files. This process is very fast because there is no "
"transcoding and so can be done in the field while shooting just as fast as "
"simply transferring the original P2 files."
