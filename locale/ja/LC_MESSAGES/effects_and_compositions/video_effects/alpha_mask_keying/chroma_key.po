"This effect allows you to do Chroma Keying (also known as Green Screen or "
"Blue Screen). Chroma keying is a visual-effects and post-production "
"compositing technique where you remove backgrounds of a similar color."

"As it name suggest this effect is very basic. It only allows to select a "
"color and specify the variance. While this may suffice for some use cases or "
"scenarios the :ref:`Chroma Key (Advanced) <effects-chroma_key_advanced>` "
"offers more parameters for more control over the keying process (background "
"removal)."

"See also the :ref:`Rotoscoping <effects-rotoscoping>` effect. Rotoscoping is "

"Key Spill Mop Up effect can be used to improve the edges of the Chroma Key "

"is when the color of the screen used for color keying spills onto the "
"subject due to light reflection."

"For more complicated scenery use the :ref:`Chroma Key (Advanced) <effects-"

"in a much more detailed fashion. Use it for less contrasting or more complex "
