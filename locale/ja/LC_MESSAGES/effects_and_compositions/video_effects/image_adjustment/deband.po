"**1st / 2nd / 3rd / 4th plane threshold** - Sets banding detection threshold "
"for each plane. Default is 0.02. Valid range is 0.00003 to 0.5. If "
"difference between current pixel and reference pixel is less than threshold, "
"it will be considered as banded."

"**Range** - Banding detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If positive, "
"random number in range 0 to set value will be used. If negative, exact "
"absolute value will be used. The range defines square of four pixels around "
"current pixel."

"**Direction** - Sets direction in radians from which four pixel will be "

"picked. If negative, exact of absolute value will be picked. For example "
"direction 0, -PI or -2*PI radians will pick only pixels on same row and -"

"**Blur** - If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all "

"**Coupling** - If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all pixel "
"components are banded, e.g. banding detection threshold is triggered for all "
"color components. The default is disabled."
