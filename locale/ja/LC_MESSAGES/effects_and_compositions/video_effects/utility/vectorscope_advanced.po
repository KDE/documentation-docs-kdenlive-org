"This effect/filter draws and overlays a vectorscope of the video data. "
"Compared to the :ref:`effects-vectorscope` effect it offers parameters to "
"control the display mode and a few other things."

"This is different from the :ref:`view-vectorscope` from the :ref:`view_menu` "
"because the Effect version writes the vectorscope into the output video, "
"whereas the View Menu version displays the vectorscope in a separate widget "
"while you still can preview your project."
