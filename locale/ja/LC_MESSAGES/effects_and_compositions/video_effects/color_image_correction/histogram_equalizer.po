"It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel "
"intensities. The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to equalize "
"their distribution across the intensity range. It may be viewed as an "
"\"automatically adjusting contrast filter\". This filter is useful only for "
"correcting degraded or poorly captured source video."

"**Strength** - Determine the amount of equalization to be applied. As the "
"strength is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more and more "
"approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number in the "

"**Intensity** - Set the maximum intensity that can generate and scale the "

"the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid wash-out. The value must be "

"**Antibanding level** - Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter "

"to avoid banding of the histogram. Possible values are **None**, **Weak** or "
"**Strong**. It defaults to **None**."
