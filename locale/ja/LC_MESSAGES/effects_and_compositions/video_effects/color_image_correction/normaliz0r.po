"**Smoothing** - The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. "

"**BlackPt / WhitePt** - Colors which define the output range. The minimum "

"the *whitept*. The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying "
"white for *blackpt* and black for *whitept* will give color-inverted, "
