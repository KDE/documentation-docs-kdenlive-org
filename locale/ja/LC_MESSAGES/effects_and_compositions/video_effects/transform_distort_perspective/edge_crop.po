"This filter is meant to be included as a normalizing filter attached "
"automatically by the loader so that cropping occurs early in the processing "
"stack and can request the full resolution of the source image. Then, a "
"second instance of the filter may be applied to set the parameters of the "
"crop operation."

"As of this writing and in version 23.04 this effect still behaves strangely. "
"The parameter values seem to interfere with each other and it is not "
"possible to have all four sides being cropped. It is either top/bottom or "
"left/right and only the last value entered is applied (and then on both "
"sides). Until this is fixed it is recommended to use the :ref:`effects-"
"crop_scale_and_tilt` effect."
