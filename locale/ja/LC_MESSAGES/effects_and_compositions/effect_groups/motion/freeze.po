"check boxes unchecked, the clip will be frozen for its entire length. To "
"change this, check either the *Freeze Before* or *Freeze After* option and "
"move the *Freeze At* slider to the time where you what the freeze to start "
"or end. If *Freeze Before* is selected, the video will be frozen at the "
"start and then start moving when it hits the *Freeze At* time. If *Freeze "
"After* is selected, the video will be moving at the start and then freeze "
"when it hits the *Freeze At* time. The audio in the video plays for the "
"entire length, i.e. the **Freeze** effect does not alter the audio."
