"Compositing is the process of combining several visual elements from "
"different sources into a single video. It involves replacing selected parts "
"of an image or video with other material, usually other images or videos."

msgid ""
"To create a composite from several clips, you make parts of one or more of "
"the clips transparent so that the other clips can show through. :doc:`Alpha "
"shapes </effects_and_filters/video_effects/alpha_mask_keying>`, :doc:"
"`rotoscoping </effects_and_filters/video_effects/alpha_mask_keying/"
"rotoscoping>`, and masks are the most common features for making portions of "
"the clips transparent."

"You can use the :guilabel:`Opacity` parameter in the :doc:`Transform </"
"effects_and_filters/video_effects/transform_distort_perspective/transform>` "
"effect to control uniform transparency of a clip. This can be animated "
"using :term:`keyframes <keyframe>` to fade a clip down or up over time."

"Some clips may have their transparency information stored in the alpha "
"channel. You can tell Kdenlive how to use this information during "
"compositing. The following file formats may contain an alpha channel:"

"Compositing more than two clips requires subsequent compositions between the "
"other tracks, or the clever use of alpha channels and mattes."

msgid ""
"In Kdenlive, you put the different sources into tracks in the **Timeline** "
"and use **Compositions** to tell Kdenlive how to combine them. For example, "
"the *Dissolve* composition fades out one clip while fading in another over a "
"certain number of frames."

"Alpha channels are taken into account automatically so that clips with alpha "
