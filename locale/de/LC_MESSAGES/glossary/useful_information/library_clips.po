"Kdenlive 16.12.0 will see **further improvements to its library clip "
"expansion** (and, in consequence, to MLT playlist import). Not every "
"Kdenlive user will notice the improved functionality, as it affects only "
"library clips where the same image sequence or title is used multiple times."

"In particular, if you (re) use the same image sequence clip, title clip, or "
"even color clip multiple times **in the same library clip**, such image "
"sequences and titles  **will only be added once to your project bin**. "
"Before Kdenlive 16.12.0, multiple instances of the same clip in the timeline "
"unfortunately resulted in these clips getting added multiple times to the "
"project bin. To emphasize, this undesired behavior only affected image "
"sequences, titles, and color clips."

"When expanding a library Kdenlive 16.12.0 will now check image sequences, "
"titles, and color clips in the timeline for their content, clip name, and "
"original bin folder location. If there is a match, then such a timeline clip "
"will be added only once to your project bin."

"A “library clip” is a clip with the “.mlt” suffix, and in particular, a clip "
"that has been added to your personal Kdenlive library. They show up in "
"Kdenlive’s library pane."

msgid ""
"Internally, when you select some clips & transitions from the timeline and "
"add them to Kdenlive’s library, these clips and transitions are stored in "
"the file system in a “.mlt” file (which is an MLT playlist to be precise), "
"and shown in the library widget as a new library clip."

msgid ""
"Technically, Kdenlive projects are also MLT playlist files. When you add a "
"clip from the library pane to your project this simply adds the underlying "
"MLT playlist file to your project. But in contrast to other clips, such as "
"an MP4 video, you can “expand” library (that is, MLT playlist) clips to get "
"back the individual clips and transitions inside it."
