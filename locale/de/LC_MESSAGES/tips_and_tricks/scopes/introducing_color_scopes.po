"Color correction is a really important topic in video editing. It starts "
"with simple stretching of the tonal range if the brightness is not ideal, "
"goes on with white balance to ensure that white remains white and not blue, "
"and finally ends with creating looks which make your video look unique. "
"Remember the blue-ish |minority_report|\\ ? The contrasty |the_departed|\\ ?"
