"Generally Primes are preferred over zooms in video. (Some people, prefer it "
"over zooms as well for photography — but this is a matter of taste and of "
"how you work.) Why is that? A psychological reason is that eyes cannot zoom "
"either, so zooming is hardly ever used in video. The technical reason is "
"that Primes are cheaper to build whilst offering better quality: Better "
"sharpness, bigger aperture (for limiting the :abbr:`DOF (Depth of Field)`). "
"Opening the aperture gives you a very nice look."

"Directly related to the previous point about lenses. Shooting with an open "
"aperture works well as long as it is dark. In bright sunlight it will fail "
"because there is too much light falling on the sensor. Furthermore you are "
"forced to use a high shutter speed which makes movements look jerky; Most of "
"the time you will want to have some kind of motion blur because it looks "
"more natural to our eyes."

"The same as for shooting stills. Really? Not quite. As written above you "
"will usually want to have the shutter speed lower than for photography in "

"Also, some additional problems may arise due to the sensor being read out "
"line-wise. One I would like to mention are Rolling Shutter effects. Longer "
"exposure can, but need not, prevent such problems. It does if you are "
"shooting with fluorescent lamps. Shooting at high shutter speed shows wave "
"patterns from top to bottom of the screen, lowering it hides them if you hit "
"the correct shutter speed."
