"Preview rendering allows you to render parts or your complete timeline in "
"the background, so you can smoothly play it back. This is especially useful "
"when you work with complex track compositions or use effects that are "
"computationally intensive. Instead of stuttering playback, you now get "
"smooth playback. This way you can check that your timing of keyframes and "
"effect is working out nicely."
