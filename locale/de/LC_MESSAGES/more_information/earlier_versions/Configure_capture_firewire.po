"AVI files may contain multiple streams. Typically, they include one video "
"and one audio stream. The native DV stream format already includes the audio "
"interleaved into its video stream. A type 1 DV AVI file only includes one DV "
"video stream where the audio must be extracted from the DV video stream. A "
"type 2 DV AVI file includes a separate audio stream in addition to the audio "
"data already interleaved in the DV video stream. Therefore, the type 2 DV "
"AVI file is redundant and consumes more space."
