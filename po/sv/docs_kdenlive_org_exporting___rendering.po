"When editing video, time means everything. Especially how long it takes you "
"to edit the clips, project, or footage you are working on. If you ever need "
"to export sequences of your timeline separately, **Kdenlive** offers a great "
"way to do this. You can set guides in your project that establish zones. You "
"then can generate rendering scripts that will export these zones at a later "
"date, during your sleep, or while you hunt and find food. Let's check out "
"how to do this."

"Next we want to add a guide for a specific section of the clip on the "

"menu and then slide down to :menuselection:`Guides` and select :"
"menuselection:`Add Guide` from the menu. Right clicking the top of the "
"timeline also gives you the option :menuselection:`Add Guide`. If you want "
"to, you can also edit the guides you have set by right clicking on the "
"timeline."

"After selecting this option, a window appears giving you the *Position* of "
