"The sharpen tool is a port of `unsharp mask <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Unsharp_masking>`_ from Mplayer. The parameters are the usual ones for "
"unsharp masking. The \"size\" means the size of the blur, and the amount is "
"how much of the blurred version gets subtracted."

"The Size parameter ranges from 0 to 1000, where 0 represents a 3x3 "
"neighbourhood, 250 represents a 5x5 neighbourhood, and 1000 represents an "
"11x11 neighbourhood. Typically values from 0-250 are a good starting point."

"The Amount parameter also ranged from 0 to 1000, and defaults to an input "
"value of 300. The default value of 300 represents a neutral input, "
"corresponding to a 0% sharpening. Increasing above 300 will increase the "
"sharpening amount, with 500 representing 100% sharpening, 700 representing "
"200% sharpening, and 1000 representing 350% sharpening. A value of 500 (ie. "
"100% sharpening) is typically a good place to start. Reducing the input to "
"below 300 will result in a gaussian blurring of the picture, with an input "
"value of 0 representing a -150% \"sharpening\" (ie. gaussian blurring)."
