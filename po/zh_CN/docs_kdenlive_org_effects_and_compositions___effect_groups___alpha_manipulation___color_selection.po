"The **Chroma-Key** is a more advanced version of the :ref:`blue_screen` "
"effect. Chroma-Key allows for some basic feathering (by changing the **Edge "
"Mode**) and much more fine-grained control over how much & in which way you "
"remove the background."

"This is better for backgrounds that have less contrast with the foreground, "
"or more complex backgrounds. For simple backgrounds (such as green, blue, "
"red or possibly black), use the :ref:`blue_screen` effect."

"After this, either choose the color using the little droplet button. Press "
"the droplet button, and then click on the background part of the clip you "
"want to remove. Adjust the Delta sliders until the background is removed "
"correctly. This might need to experimenting. If you find it isn't removing "
"the background well, try changing the \"selection subspace\" and experiment "
"again. If you experimented and cycled through all the \"selection subspaces"
"\", and the background isn't still removed properly, then it is probably too "
"complicated for **Kdenlive** to remove. At this point, you will need to use :"
