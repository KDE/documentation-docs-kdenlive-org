"The interface is divided into many sections. The menu is on top and then on "

"list. You can apply many transaction effects on your video. You can always "
"watch the project preview in the last section. You can create as many audio/"
"video track as you need. This is impressive about Kdenlive. If you’re new to "
"video editing then this is very useful. You can import multiple title clips "
"inside video track."

"Replicating the folder naming system within the editing software library "

"with one or more descriptive keywords. These can be searched and are a "
"useful way to rapidly locate the desired footage, especially with the use of "
