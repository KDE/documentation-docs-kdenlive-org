":menuselection:`Space` brings up a submenu with :menuselection:`Insert "
"Space` and :menuselection:`Remove Space` options.  Inserting a space is a "
"useful feature when you want to push all the existing clips on the timeline "
"aside to make room for new clips but also want to preserve the relationships "
"among all the clips that were shifted, including their transitions."

"In addition to invoking this menu from :menuselection:`Timeline --> Space`, "
"you can also bring it up by right-clicking on an empty spot on a track in "
"the timeline.  There are a couple of important differences with how :"
"menuselection:`Insert Space` behaves, though, depending on which method you "
"choose.  First, using :menuselection:`Timeline --> Space --> Insert Space` "
"brings up the **Add Space** dialog shown in Figure 1 where the default "
"choice for **Track:** is *All tracks*."

"When you access the menu by right-clicking on a track, the same dialog "
"appears but the default is the track you clicked on.  In either case, you "
"can obviously override the default by picking another option (Figure 2).  "
"The other difference is that the insertion happens at the playhead when the "
"operation originates from the Timeline menu; it takes place at the mouse "
"cursor position when right-clicking."

"And in case you're wondering, the default **Duration** for the inserted "
"space is 65 frames, which is not configurable in the Kdenlive or Project "
"settings.  65 frames will equate to different amounts of time depending on "
"the frame rate set in your project profile.  In the example, our project's "
"frame rate happens to be 30 fps and that's why the default **Duration** "
"works out to be 00:00:02.05."

"Let's look at an example, albeit an unrealistic one, of how inserting a "
"space from the playhead position will affect clips and transitions on "
"different tracks.  In general, inserting a space will shift any clips that "
"the playhead is touching as well as all clips to the right of the playhead "
"on the affected track(s).  Transitions are a little trickier because they "
"span two tracks.  They are assumed to “belong” to the higher track "
"(regardless of the direction of the transition) and so if the playhead is "
"touching them, they will go if the higher track is included in the shift."
