"In version 17.04 of Kdenlive you can add Fade to Black and Fade from Black "
"effects with a single click. And you can adjust the length of the fade with "
"a drag of the mouse. Hover over the grey rectangle that appears in the top "
"corner at the end of the clip on the time line and a tool tip will appear "
"saying \"Drag to Add or Resize a Fade Effect\". And if you do Drag you will "
"add a Fade to Black or a Fade From Black effect (depending on which end of "
"the clip you are working on)."
