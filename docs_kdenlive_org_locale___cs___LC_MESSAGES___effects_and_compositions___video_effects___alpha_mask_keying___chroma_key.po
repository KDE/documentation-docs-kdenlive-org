"This effect allows you to do Chroma Keying (also known as Green Screen or "
"Blue Screen). Chroma keying is a visual-effects and post-production "
"compositing technique where you remove backgrounds of a similar color."

"As it name suggest this effect is very basic. It only allows to select a "
"color and specify the variance. While this may suffice for some use cases or "
"scenarios the :ref:`Chroma Key (Advanced) <effects-chroma_key_advanced>` "
"offers more parameters for more control over the keying process (background "
"removal)."

"For black backgrounds it is more efficient to use a :guilabel:`Screen` "
"Composition. More details are available in the :ref:`Compositions <effects-"
"compositions>` section of the documentation."

"Press on the button that looks like pipette, and then click on the "

"Use the :guilabel:`Variance` slider to control the amount of background "

"See also the :ref:`Rotoscoping <effects-rotoscoping>` effect. Rotoscoping is "
"where you manually draw a region and everything outside/inside that region "
"will disappear. This is useful for backgrounds with multiple different "

"See also the :ref:`Key Spill Mop Up <effects-key_spill_mop_up>` effect. The "
"Key Spill Mop Up effect can be used to improve the edges of the Chroma Key "
"effect when edge problems occur that are caused by \"key spill\". Key spill "
"is when the color of the screen used for color keying spills onto the "
"subject due to light reflection."

"For more complicated scenery use the :ref:`Chroma Key (Advanced) <effects-"
"chroma_key_advanced>` effect which also does color based alpha selection but "
"in a much more detailed fashion. Use it for less contrasting or more complex "
"backgrounds."
