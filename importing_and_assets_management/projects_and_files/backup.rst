  :alt: Backup widget

The Backup widget, found in :menuselection:`Project --> Open Backup File` allows you to restore a previous version of your project file.


In case something went wrong (corrupted project file, unwanted change, ...), you can now restore a previous version of the file using this feature. Just select the version you want and click :menuselection:`Open`.

The backup files are automatically created each time you save your project. This means that if you save your project every hour, the backup widget will show you a list of all the saved files, with a small image of the timeline at the time you saved the project.


**Kdenlive** keeps up to 20 versions of your project file in the last hour, 20 versions from the current day, 20 versions in the last 7 days and 20 older versions, which should be sufficient to recover from any problem.
