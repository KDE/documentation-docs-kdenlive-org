Sometimes, you want to keep some notes about your project to remember ideas or things to do. For this task, **Kdenlive** provides a "Notes" widget that is available through :menuselection:`View --> Project Notes`.

It is basically a small text editor, but also has the ability to create links to some places in your project's timeline. To add a timeline link as shown in the snapshot on the left, right click in the Notes widget and choose :menuselection:`Insert Current Timecode`. That will add a clickable link to the current project monitor timecode.

You can also provide annotations using :ref:`guides` or  :ref:`clips`
