"This effect is used in combination with chroma keying (otherwise known as "
"Greenscreen or Bluescreen). Its purpose is to compensate for the fact that "
"sometimes the color from the green or blue screen reflects onto the subject "
"and will make them a shade of blue or green especially around the edges. "
"This is known as \"key spill\". This effect can attempt to compensate for "
"this issue."
