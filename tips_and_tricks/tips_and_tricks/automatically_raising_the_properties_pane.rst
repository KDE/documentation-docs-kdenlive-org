Automatically Raising the Properties Pane
=========================================

Depending on your workflow habits, you can configure when to raise the properties pane (in case it is currently hidden).

Go to :menuselection:`Menu --> Settings --> Configure Kdenlive`, then select the tab :guilabel:`Timeline`.

You should now see a group titled **Raise Properties Pane when Selecting in Timeline**, which contains these three check boxes:

:guilabel:`Clips`, :guilabel:`Transitions`, and :guilabel:`Tracks`

Simply check the timeline elements for which you want the properties pane to be automatically raised (shown) when you select them in the timeline.

The default (classic) behavior of Kdenlive is to automatically raise the properties pane for all clips, transitions, and tracks.
