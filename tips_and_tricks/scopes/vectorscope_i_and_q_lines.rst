Vectorscope I and Q Lines
=========================

The Vectorscope has an option to draw I/Q lines. So you may be wondering what are they good for?

Where I/Q lines Come From
-------------------------

You may remember from the :doc:`Vectorscope chapter <vectorscope_working>` that the Vectorscope uses a color space different than RGB. In the image above it is :term:`YUV`, in the image below it is :term:`YPbPr`. They both share the property that the Y component represents :term:`Luma` only (i.e. how bright a pixel is), and the other two components represent :term:`Chroma` (colour) by expressing deviations from neutral color on the red-green and yellow-blue axis. (These are complementary colours each, so mixing them in equal parts results in neutral again - which is why they can be used for the deviation.)

YUV is the standard color space for analog PAL television. NTSC, the american analog TV standard, uses a color space I did not mention yet: :term:`YIQ`. The special thing about this color space is that the I component was chosen such that skin tones (also known as flesh tones) lie on the I line (orange-blue), and it was given more than four times as much bandwidth as the Q component (which represents the green-purple line; the human eye is also less sensitive for changes on this line).

Purpose of the I and the Q line
-------------------------------

Displaying the Q and especially the I line is to help with skin tones. There is a rule of thumb in post production saying that all skin tones should approximately lie on the I line. If it is not, you might want to |color-correct| your clip.

The simple reason for this is that our eyes are trained on skin tones, and if skin tones in your video do not lie in the I line they are very likely to look unnatural. There are very good picture examples in the Save our Skins article mentioned above.
